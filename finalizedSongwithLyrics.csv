Woo, woo
I pull up like
How you pull up, Baby? How you pull up? (Oh, oh, oh)
How you pull up? I pull up (Woo, SethInTheKitchen)

[Chorus: DaBaby]
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

[Verse 1: DaBaby]
It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, ""You play, you lay,"" don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: DaBaby & Roddy Ricch]
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo, yeah)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Roddy Ricch]
Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote

[Chorus: DaBaby]
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)

[Intro: beabadoobe]
No te quedes despierto por mucho tiempo, no te vayas a la cama
Haré una taza de café para tu cabeza
Te levantará y sacará de la cama

[Verso 1: Powfu]
Sí, no me quiero quedar dormido, no me quiero desmayar
Estuve pensando en nuestro futuro porque nunca veré esos días
No sé por qué esto ha sucedido, pero probablemente me lo merezco
Intenté dar lo mejor de mí, pero sabes que no soy perfecto
He estado orando por el perdón, tú has estado orando por mi salud
Cuando me vaya de esta tierra, esperando que encuentres a alguien más
Porque sí, seguimos siendo jóvenes, hay mucho que no hemos hecho
Casarse, formar una familia, mirar a tu esposo con su hijo
Ojalá pudiera ser yo, pero no saldré de esta cama
Espero ir al cielo así podré verte una vez más
Mi vida fue algo corta, pero tuve tantas bendiciones
Feliz de que fueras mía, apesta que todo esté terminando

[Coro: beabadoobe, Powfu, beabadoobe & Powfu]
No te quedes despierto por mucho tiempo, no te vayas a la cama
Haré una taza de café para tu cabeza
Te levantará y sacará de la cama (Sí, ey)
No te quedes despierto por mucho tiempo, no te vayas a la cama
Haré una taza de café para tu cabeza
Te levantará y sacará de la cama (Ey, sí)

[Verso 2: Powfu]
Estoy feliz de que estés conmigo, perdón si lagrimeo
Cuando tú y yo éramos jóvenes, siempre me animarías
Filmando videos bobos y caminando por del parque
Saltarías en mis brazos al escuchar un ladrido
Nos acurrucaríamos en tus sábanas, me cantarías dormida
Y nos escaparíamos por tu cocina exactamente a las 1:03
Domingos, íbamos a misa, los lunes, mirábamos una película
Pronto estarás sola, perdón por perderme

[Coro: beabadoobe, beabadoobe & Powfu]
No te quedes despierto por mucho tiempo, no te vayas a la cama
Haré una taza de café para tu cabeza
Te levantará y sacará de la cama
No te quedes despierto por mucho tiempo, no te vayas a la cama
Haré una taza de café para tu cabeza
Te levantará y sacará de la cama
No te quedes despierto por mucho tiempo, no te vayas a la cama
Haré una taza de café para tu cabeza
Te levantará y sacará de la cama
No te quedes despierto por mucho tiempo, no te vayas a la cama
Haré una taza de café para tu cabeza

Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' first
You got a way of keeping me comin' back to back
I just found out, the only reason that you lovin' me
Was to get back at your ex lover but before you leave
Usually I would never, would never even care
Baby I know she creepin', I feel it in the air

Protests and growing national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd (Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)

[Verse 1]
Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather

[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

[Verse 2]
Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names

[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

[Verse 3]
They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah

[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here

Too early, maybe later you can show me things

Pistol on J for survival
Lot of people gunnin' for the title
Lot of people tryna take us viral
I'm just tryin' to have a nice night though
Waiter brought the check for the meal
She said, ""Babe, I think there was a typo""
Nah, girl, I got it, that's light though
I could show you bigger things than that
It's gon' be a minute 'til I'm back
Let me give you images that last
AMEX had a limit in the past
I had plenty women in the past
I done plenty sinnin' in the past
You don't need to know, but you can ask
Stickin' on your backstage pass
All access 'cause you bad
You could go wherever with that ass
Show to the shower to the truck
Truck to the club for the party
You go in first with your girls
'Cause I don't know who's out there watchin'

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
But I do know one thing though
Women they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday, Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then, I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway
On this one way

At a table dealing Blackjack

And she's taught to fear the Bible
But she's got a couple friends that she runs around with
Dancin' with the Devil

In a lonely, crowded city

Rides away

You did read it, and it will happen. Post Malone has recently joined the exclusive list of artists to perform on Virtual Reality. The concert, scheduled for 17 of October will take place on the Raleigh’s PNC Arena, and streamed through the Oculus Venue app. So everyone who owns an Oculus headset will be able to watch the concert on a 180 perspective through Oculus Venues.

Post Malone is ready to “Bend Minds”, according to Billboard, and they are not wrong, the concert is going to be one of the increasing amounts of events to be streamed on VR this year, through the Oculus Venue app.

The Raleigh’s PNC Arena, in North Carolina, will hold the event that will be streamed in a 180 degrees perspective through Oculus Venue, an app of the VR company to watch exclusive events through Oculus devices.

The Grammy-winning artist dropped his most recent album, Hollywood’s Bleeding, back in September with some great collaborators, such as Ozzy Osborne and Travis Scott in the track “Take What You Want”, and Halsey alongside Future for “Die For Me”. The record also includes the singles “Wow” and “Sunflower” (Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse) featuring Swae Lee, both reaching the top 10 of the Global Chart on Spotify.

Malone talked about the concert and according to Variety stated that “When putting together this tour, I wanted to make sure I was giving my fans something new and crazy with this new production and show.“ Later adding that “Working with Oculus on this VR broadcast gives fans at home a chance to sit front row with me during my North Carolina show, just like you’re in the arena. That sounds pretty f***ing cool to me.”

PREVIOUS CONCERTS BROADCASTED ON VR
The concert will make Austin Richard Post Aka Post Malone, one of the few people to have done this kind of show. Still, among important artists who have done it before there are Billie Eilish, who did it a month ago, and Tenacious D.

Tenacious D went out to do it on July 31st and many agree saying that it was a success and that the experience actually made it more comfortable. An unexpected advantage of “different state legislation” for some people, as it is mentioned in this article from The Cult Machine.
Moving a little closer on time, on September 3rd, we were able to see Billie Eilish’s concert being streamed on VR, using Oculus Venues as the platform as well. Eilish played in Madrid, Spain, and according to many articles, the experience and opinions may vary a lot, as it is explained in this article from the UploadVR.

According to iHeartRadio, she talked about the concert stating that ""I make everybody get really low, and we all jump when the drop comes in. Even though you'll be watching on a VR headset, you should still get low and jump with everyone.""

Besides music, there’s a lot of exclusive events that plan on going towards Virtual Reality, including the NBA. Last September they announced their collaboration with many VR platform to broadcast about 26 games starting this October. It is likely that soon you can watch the NFL season and bet on the Superbowl favorites, using VR technology.

VR HAS TAKEN OVER THE LAST YEAR
Although the recent concerts of some of the biggest stars of the moment have made VR reach a spotlight, there are a couple of extra apps that have taken a step forward on this remark. They are having thesigning deals with some of the biggest record labels and allowing us to feel we are on the crowds of different concerts, events or even festivals.

It is safe to say that Virtual Reality keeps breaking walls but is also worth to think for a minute how this could affect the trends, the attendances to concerts and many other factors. Also, what could change into the VR Apps for this kind of shows, if microtransactions are a possibility or any possible alteration in the near future."

You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and Louis V carpet

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

[Chorus: Juice WRLD with Eminem]
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm fittin' to kill 'em and dumpin' their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
Or be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blown up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—

He's not a cheater, a believer
He's a warm, warm-blooded achiever
It's a lonely night in my bed in the heat of the summer, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]
It's so hard when you're with someone
Your heart breaks and it ain't no fun
But I gotta take that risk tonight

[Chorus: Sam Smith & Demi Lovato]
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
For someone to love me (For someone to love me)
I'm ready (I'm ready), I'm ready (I'm ready)
I'm ready (I'm ready), I'm ready (I'm ready)
For someone to love me, for someone to love me

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
Oh, yeah
It's a hot night in my head in the chill of the winter
No, I've been lookin' hard for a lover disguised as a sinner
No, not a cheater, a redeemer
He's a cold, cold-blooded defeater
It's a hot night in my head in the chill of the winter, no

[Pre-Chorus: Both & Demi Lovato]
It's so hard when you're with someone
Your heart breaks and it ain't no fun (Breaks)
But I gotta take that risk tonight

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
For someone to love me (For someone to love me)
I'm ready (I'm ready), I'm ready (I'm ready)
I'm ready (I'm ready), I'm ready (I'm ready)
For someone to love me, for someone to love me, yeah

[Bridge: Sam Smith & Demi Lovato]
Oh, oh
It's a cold night in my bed in the heat of the summer
No, I've been lookin' hard for a lover disguised as a sinner

[Chorus: Sam Smith, Demi Lovato & Both]
I'm ready (I'm ready), I'm ready (I'm ready)
I'm ready (I'm ready), I'm ready (I'm ready)
For someone to love me (For someone to love me)
I'm ready (I'm ready), I'm ready (I'm ready)
I'm ready (I'm ready), I'm ready (I'm ready)
For someone to love me, for someone to love me"
