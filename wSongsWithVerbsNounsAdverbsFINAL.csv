1,Paper Doll,['John Mayer'],"Paper doll come try it on
And step out of that black chiffon
Here's a dress of gold and blue
Sure was fun being good to you

This one we made just for fall
And winter runs a bit too small
This mint green is new for spring
My love didn't cost a thing

You're like 22 girls in one
And none of them know what they're running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll?

Fold a scarf, Moroccan red
And tie your hair behind your head
Strap into some heels that hurt
You shoulda kept my undershirt

You're like 22 girls in one
And none of them know what they're running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll?

Cut the cord and pull some strings
And make yourself some angel wings
And if those angel wings don't fly
Someone's gonna paint you another sky

24,Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,['The Andrews Sisters'],"He was a famous trumpet man from out Chicago way
He had a boogie style that no one else could play
He was the top man at his craft
But then his number came up and he was gone with the draft
He's in the army now, a-blowin' reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B

They made him blow a bugle for his Uncle Sam
It really brought him down because he couldn't jam

Because the next day the cap' went out and drafted a band
And now the company jumps when he plays reveille

He makes the company jump when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B

He was our boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
And when he plays boogie woogie bugle he was busy as a 'bzzz' bee
And when he plays he makes the company jump eight-to-the-bar

He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B

He puts the boys asleep with boogie every night
And wakes 'em up the same way in the early bright
They clap their hands and stamp their feet
Because they know how he plays when someone gives him a beat

27,These Foolish Things,['Dick Haymes'],"A cigarette that bares a lipstick`s traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you.
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumblin`words That told you what my heart meant
A fairground`s painted swings
These foolish things
remind me of you.
You came,
You saw,
You conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March That made my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings But who`s to answer
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things
Remind me of you
First daffodils
And long excited cables
And candle lights
A little corner table
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening
When the bell has sounded
The pier in France
With all the gulls around it
The beauty that is spring
These foolish things
Remind me of you
How strange,
How sweet,
To find you still,
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains
At empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside
Dance invitations
Oh how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things
Remind me of you
Gardenia perfume
Lingering on a pillow
Wild strawberries
Only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings,
These foolish things,
Remind me of you
The smile of Garbo
And the scent of roses
The waiters whistling
As the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things
Remind me of you
How strange
How sweet
To find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

The wail of steamers

38,Don't Cry Baby,['Erskine Hawkins'],"I just needed someone, somebody to hold
When the bottle was empty
And the nights grew cold
In my hour of darkness
In my time of need
You were my angel of mercy
And helped me to believe
You touched my soul
When I was lonely
You held me up
When I couldn't fly
There's no words could explain
How I feel inside
And this I tell you
In a world full of anger
In times gone strange
You held me close
You held me close to you
Lay my head on your shoulder
I finally let it all out
It felt good for a moment
Not living in a shadow of doubt
But everybody needs a little something
To pull them through
I gave one for the other
And God know that the other was you
Now only time will tell
Only time will tell
If our love is scratched in sand
Or if it's etched in stone
Only time will tell
Only time will tell
If our love will stand
Or walk the road alone
My angel of mercy
Pulled me through somehow
I just hope you know
I need you now

55,There's No Business Like Show Business,"['Irving Berlin', 'Ethel Merman']","There's no business like show business like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing, everything that traffic will allow
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra bow
There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold, you may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold, let's go on with the show
The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Are secretly unhappy men because
The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Get paid for what they do but no applause.
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye for anything theatrical and why?
There's no business like show business and I tell you it's so
Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on opening nights
Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there in lights
There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's no attack
Where could you get money that you don't give back? Let's go on with the show
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on
Yesterday they told you you would not go far, that night you open and there you are
Next day on your dressing room they've hung a star, let's go on with the show!!",show know appeal will allow could steal show smile know will fold may strand would change let go pay 'd bid tell travel stand open smile watch show smile come lose could give let go get start die part break go tell would go open hang let go,business business business traffic feeling bow people people turkey sack gold show butcher grocer clerk man butcher grocer clerk applause job goodbye business show business country front night theater filling billing light people people lot jack attack money show word show uncle dawn top yesterday night day dressing room star show,nowhere when when even still secretly gladly why so so out there when everywhere when where back far there,business like business like business know appeal traffic allow happy feeling steal extra bow people like people smile low turkey know fold strand cold change sack gold let butcher baker grocer clerk secretly unhappy man butcher baker grocer clerk pay applause gladly bid dreary job goodbye theatrical business like business tell travel country thrilling stand open night smile watch theater filling billing light people like people smile low Angels come lot jack lose attack money let word start favorite uncle die dawn pa ma part break hearted yesterday tell far night open day dressing room hang star let ,270,151

At a book to find,
What he thinks of the moon,
And what is on his mind,
That comes naturally.

Can't even write his name,
He signs his checks with ""X's"",
But they cash 'em just the same.

68,"On The Atchison, Topeka And The Santa Fe","['Judy Garland', 'The Merry Macs']","What a lovely trip,
I'm feeling so fresh an alive,
And I'm so glad to arrive,
It's all so grand.
It's easy to see,
You don't need a palace,
To feel like Alice,
In wonderland.

Back in Ohio,
Where I come from,
I've done a lot of dreamin' an I've traveled some,
But I never thought I'd see the day,
When I ever took a ride on The Santa Fe.
(Wanna take a ride on The Santa Fe).

I would lean across my window sill,
And hear the whistle echoin across the hill,
Then I'd watch the lights, till they fade away,
On the Atchison, Topeka, and The Santa Fe.

What a thrill,
(What a great big wonderful thrill).
With the wheels a singin' westward ho,
Right from the day I heard them start.
Cross the Kansas plains from New Mexico,
I guess I've got a little gypsy in my heart.

When I'm old and gray and settled down,
If I ever get a chance to sneak away from town,
Then I'll spend my busmen's holiday,
On The Atchison, Topeka, and The Santa Fe.

(All aboard)!
All aboard!
(We came across the country, lickedy spilt).
I can't believe I'm here at last.
I can't believe that anything could go so fast.
Then you pull that throttle whistle blows,
A huffin and a puffin and a way she goes.
All aboard for Calaforn-i-a.

Now he's on a battleship in his sailor suit
Just a great big sailor but she thinks he's very cute

She loves her sailor and he loves her too)
When her sailor boy's away on the ocean blue
Soldier boys all flirt with her but to him she's true
Though they smile and tip their caps and they wink their eyes
She just smiles and shakes her head, then she softly sighs

When her sailor went to sea to see what he could see
She saw that he ate spinach, now he's big as he can be

She won't let go of his hand, even to salute

79,"If I Loved You - From the Musical Production ""Carousel""",['Perry Como'],"But somehow I can see
Just exactly how I'd be
If I loved you,
Time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know.
If I loved you,
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go!
Longin' to tell you,
But afraid and shy,
I'd let my golden chances pass me by!
Soon you'd leave me,
Off you would go in the mist of day,
Never, never to know how I loved you
If I loved you.
Well, anyway, you mean you don't love me.
That's what you said, isn't it?
Yes!
I can smell 'em, can you, ah?
The blossoms. The wind brings 'em down!
Billy there ain't much wind tonight
Hardly any.
You can't hear a sound, not the turn of a leaf
Nor the fall of a wave hittin' the sand.
The tide's creepin' up on the beach like a thief,
Afraid to be caught stealin' the land!
On a night like this I start to wonder
What life is all about.
And I always say two heads are better than one to
figure it out.
I don't need you, I don't need anybody helpin' me.
Well, I got it figured out for myself.
We're not important. What are we?
A couple o' specks with nothin'
Look up there
There's a hell of a lotta stars in the sky,
And the sky's so big the sea looks small,
And two little people, you and I
We don't count at all.
You're a funny kid, you know?
I don't remember meetin' a girl like you.
Hey, you're tryin' to get me to marry you?
No!
Then what's puttin' into my head, babe?
You're diff'rent, alright! I know what it is...
You have doped me with that little kid's face, right?
You've adjusted me!
I wonder what it'd be like
What?
Nothin'.
No, I know what it'd be like.
It'd be awful! I can just see myself-
Kinda scrawny, and pale
Picking at my food,
And love-sick like any other guy.
I'd throw away my sweater, and dress up like a dude
In a dicky and a collar and a tie.
If I loved you.
But you don't!
No, I don't!
But somehow I can see
Just exactly how I'd be

No, even if a girl was foolish enough to want me to,
I wouldn't!
