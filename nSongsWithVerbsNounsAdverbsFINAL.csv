How you pull up, Baby? How you pull up? (Oh, oh, oh)
How you pull up? I pull up (Woo, SethInTheKitchen)


Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop


It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, ""You play, you lay,"" don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (Yeah, yeah)

Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote

Don't like where I'm at
34  was bad, so I just turn to 35
Yeah,  I'm a keeper
I keep digging down for the deep
Like  the records I'm playing
They might keep you waiting
But you know I'm only playing for keeps


And if the house just keeps on winning
I  got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart

Yeah, and I'm still giving 'em hell
Forgiving's pretty hard
So I made an art out of forgettin' 'em well
Yeah, I'm a rhymer
I can turn 20 cents into a 10
And if I get confused and I start to lose
I rhyme a dime 'til it all makes sense


And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain


Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all

I see your face in the clouds
I smell your perfume in crowds
I swear your number's all my phone wants to call


It's kinda funny how I can't seem
To get away from you
It's almost like you don't want me to


You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey, but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight
In that dress just to mess with my head
So much for so long

Told me to leave all your things
Out on the porch, on the swing
You'd come and grab 'em by the end of the week
Well, it's just some jeans and a shirt
But it's a whole lot of hurt

Two pieces shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, it goes like


One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
""Hey, Señorita, don't you think we need a salt and a Buffett song?""
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita

To tuck the bloodshot away
Hair of the dog, shouldn't take long

Palm trees a-leanin', sunburn screamin'

I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah


Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt


All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden
They say I'll be great, I guess I'm waiting for it

Protests and growing national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd (Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)


Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather


It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear


Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names


It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear


They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah


It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life

You did read it, and it will happen. Post Malone has recently joined the exclusive list of artists to perform on Virtual Reality. The concert, scheduled for 17 of October will take place on the Raleigh’s PNC Arena, and streamed through the Oculus Venue app. So everyone who owns an Oculus headset will be able to watch the concert on a 180 perspective through Oculus Venues.

Post Malone is ready to “Bend Minds”, according to Billboard, and they are not wrong, the concert is going to be one of the increasing amounts of events to be streamed on VR this year, through the Oculus Venue app.

The Raleigh’s PNC Arena, in North Carolina, will hold the event that will be streamed in a 180 degrees perspective through Oculus Venue, an app of the VR company to watch exclusive events through Oculus devices.

The Grammy-winning artist dropped his most recent album, Hollywood’s Bleeding, back in September with some great collaborators, such as Ozzy Osborne and Travis Scott in the track “Take What You Want”, and Halsey alongside Future for “Die For Me”. The record also includes the singles “Wow” and “Sunflower” (Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse) featuring Swae Lee, both reaching the top 10 of the Global Chart on Spotify.

Malone talked about the concert and according to Variety stated that “When putting together this tour, I wanted to make sure I was giving my fans something new and crazy with this new production and show.“ Later adding that “Working with Oculus on this VR broadcast gives fans at home a chance to sit front row with me during my North Carolina show, just like you’re in the arena. That sounds pretty f***ing cool to me.”

PREVIOUS CONCERTS BROADCASTED ON VR
The concert will make Austin Richard Post Aka Post Malone, one of the few people to have done this kind of show. Still, among important artists who have done it before there are Billie Eilish, who did it a month ago, and Tenacious D.

Tenacious D went out to do it on July 31st and many agree saying that it was a success and that the experience actually made it more comfortable. An unexpected advantage of “different state legislation” for some people, as it is mentioned in this article from The Cult Machine.
Moving a little closer on time, on September 3rd, we were able to see Billie Eilish’s concert being streamed on VR, using Oculus Venues as the platform as well. Eilish played in Madrid, Spain, and according to many articles, the experience and opinions may vary a lot, as it is explained in this article from the UploadVR.

According to iHeartRadio, she talked about the concert stating that ""I make everybody get really low, and we all jump when the drop comes in. Even though you'll be watching on a VR headset, you should still get low and jump with everyone.""

Besides music, there’s a lot of exclusive events that plan on going towards Virtual Reality, including the NBA. Last September they announced their collaboration with many VR platform to broadcast about 26 games starting this October. It is likely that soon you can watch the NFL season and bet on the Superbowl favorites, using VR technology.

VR HAS TAKEN OVER THE LAST YEAR
Although the recent concerts of some of the biggest stars of the moment have made VR reach a spotlight, there are a couple of extra apps that have taken a step forward on this remark. They are having thesigning deals with some of the biggest record labels and allowing us to feel we are on the crowds of different concerts, events or even festivals.

It is safe to say that Virtual Reality keeps breaking walls but is also worth to think for a minute how this could affect the trends, the attendances to concerts and many other factors. Also, what could change into the VR Apps for this kind of shows, if microtransactions are a possibility or any possible alteration in the near future.",read will happen join perform schedule will take stream own will watch bend accord go increase stream will hold will stream watch win drop bleed take want die include feature reach talk accord state put want make give add work give sit be sound f***e will make do do go agree say make mention move see stream use play accord may vary explain accord talk state make jump come will watch should jump ’ plan go include announce broadcast start can watch bet use have make reach take have thesigne allow feel say keep break think could affect could change,author list artist reality concert place app headset concert perspective concert amount event year app event degree perspective app company event device artist album collaborator track record single sunflower malone concert tour fan production show broadcast fan home chance row show arena previous concerts concert people kind show artist month 31st success experience advantage state legislation people article time 3rd concert platform article experience opinion lot article concert drop headset music lot event reality collaboration platform game season favorite technology year concert star moment spotlight couple app step remark deal record label crowd concert event festival reality wall minute trend attendance concert factor kind show microtransaction possibility alteration future,recently so most back also when together later just pretty still ago actually more close as well really when even still about soon forward even also how also,author Jorge Ramos read happen Post Malone recently join exclusive list artist perform virtual reality concert schedule 17 October place Raleigh PNC Arena stream Oculus Venue app own Oculus headset able watch concert 180 perspective Oculus Venues Post Malone ready bend Minds accord Billboard wrong concert go increase amount event stream VR year Oculus Venue app Raleigh PNC Arena North Carolina hold event stream 180 degree perspective Oculus Venue app VR company watch exclusive event Oculus device Grammy win artist drop recent album Hollywood bleed September great collaborator Ozzy Osborne Travis Scott track want Halsey alongside Future die record include single wow sunflower Spiderman Spider Verse feature Swae Lee reach 10 Global Chart Spotify malone talk concert accord Variety state put tour want sure give fan new crazy new production later add work Oculus VR broadcast give fan home chance sit row North Carolina like arena sound pretty f e cool previous concerts BROADCASTED VR concert Austin Richard Post Aka Post Malone people kind important artist Billie Eilish month ago tenacious D Tenacious D go July 31st agree say success experience actually comfortable unexpected advantage different state legislation people mention article Cult Machine move little close time September 3rd able Billie Eilish concert stream VR Oculus Venues platform Eilish play Madrid Spain accord article experience opinion vary lot explain article UploadVR accord iHeartRadio talk concert state everybody low jump drop come watch VR headset low jump music lot exclusive event plan go virtual reality include NBA September announce collaboration VR platform broadcast 26 game start October likely soon watch NFL season bet Superbowl favorite VR technology VR TAKEN year recent concert big star moment VR reach spotlight couple extra app take step forward remark have thesigne deal big record label allow feel crowd different concert event festival safe virtual reality keep break wall worth think minute affect trend attendance concert factor change VR Apps kind show microtransaction possibility possible alteration near future ,672,376

I was distracted and in traffic
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out




I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine




But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant


If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye


If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?



[Pink Sweat$, Jordan Davis, Sasha Sloan & Anne-Marie]
I tried to imagine your reaction
It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen


Ah, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out




I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine




But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant


Si el mundo se acaba, ¿tú vendrías, verdad?
Los dos cayendo con la gravedad
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye

You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?

It's a cold night in my bed in the heat of the summer
I've been waitin' patiently for a beautiful lover
He's not a cheater, a believer
He's a warm, warm-blooded achiever
It's a lonely night in my bed in the heat of the summer, oh

Your heart breaks and it ain't no fun
But I gotta take that risk tonight

No, I've been lookin' hard for a lover disguised as a sinner
No, not a cheater, a redeemer
He's a cold, cold-blooded defeater
It's a hot night in my head in the chill of the winter, no


It's so hard when you're with someone
Your heart breaks and it ain't no fun (Breaks)
