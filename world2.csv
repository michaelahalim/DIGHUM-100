Pistol Packin' Mama - Single Version,"['Bing Crosby', 'The Andrews Sisters', 'Vic Schoen & His Orchestra']","Lay that pistol down, babe
Lay that pistol down
Pistol packing mama
Lay that pistol down
Oh, drinking beer in a cabaret
Was I having fun
Until one night she caught me right
And now I'm on the run
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe
Lay that pistol down
Pistol packing mama
Lay that pistol down
Oh, I'll sing you every night Bing
And I'll woo you every day
I'll be your regular mama
And I'll put that gun away
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe
Lay that pistol down
Pistol packing mama
Lay that thing down
Before it goes off
And hurts somebody
Oh, she kicked out my windshield
And she hit me over the head
She cussed and cried and said I lied
And she wished that I was dead
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe
Lay that pistol down
Pistol packing mama
Lay that pistol down
We're three tough gals
From deep down Texas way
We got no pals
They don't like the way we play
We're a rough rooting tooting shooting trio
But you ought to see my sister Cleo
She's a terror make no error
But there ain't no nicer terror
Here's what we tell her
Lay that pistol down, babe
Lay that pistol down
Pistol packing mama
Lay that pistol down
Pappy made a batch of corn
The revenuers came
The drought was slow
So now they know
You can't do that to Mame
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe
Lay that pistol down
Pistol packing mama
Lay that pistol down
Oh, singing songs in a cabaret
Was I having fun
Until one night it didn't seem right
And now I'm on the run
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe
Lay that pistol down
Pistol packing mama
Lay that pistol down
Oh, pistol packing mama
Lay that pistol down"
Paper Doll,['John Mayer'],"Paper doll come try it on
And step out of that black chiffon
Here's a dress of gold and blue
Sure was fun being good to you

This one we made just for fall
And winter runs a bit too small
This mint green is new for spring
My love didn't cost a thing

You're like 22 girls in one
And none of them know what they're running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll?

Fold a scarf, Moroccan red
And tie your hair behind your head
Strap into some heels that hurt
You shoulda kept my undershirt

You're like 22 girls in one
And none of them know what they're running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll?

Cut the cord and pull some strings
And make yourself some angel wings
And if those angel wings don't fly
Someone's gonna paint you another sky

'Cause you're like 22 girls in one
And none of them know what they're running from
Was it just too far to fall
Was it just too far to fall"
I've Heard That Song Before,['Harry James'],"It seems to me I've heard that song before
It's from an old familiar score
I know it well, that melody
It's funny how a theme recalls a favorite dream
A dream that brought you so close to me
I know each word because I've heard that song before
The lyrics said ""Forever more""
Forever more's a memory
Please have them play it again
And I'll remember just when
I heard that lovely song before"
You'll Never Know,['Dick Haymes'],"You'll never know just how much I miss you
You'll never know just how much I care
And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you
You ought to know or haven't I told you so
A million or more times?

You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you
I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now

You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you
I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now
You'll never know if you don't know now"
"Sunday, Monday Or Always",['Jimmy Scott'],"Oh, won't you tell me when
We will meet again
Sunday, Monday or always
If you're satisfied
I'll be at your side
Sunday, Monday or always
No need to tell me now
What makes the world go 'round
When at the sight of you
My heart begins to pound and pound
And what am I to do
Can't I be with you
Sunday, Monday or always
Oh, won't you tell me when
We will meet again
Sunday, Monday or always
If you're satisfied
I'll be at your side
Sunday, Monday or always
No need to tell me now
What makes the world go 'round
When at the sight of you
My heart begins to pound, pound, pound
What am I to do
Can't I be with you
Sunday, Monday or always"
My Heart Tells Me (with Mark Warnow & The Hit Parade Orchestra),"['Frank Sinatra', 'Mark Warnow & The Hit Parade Orchestra']","My heart tells me this is just a fling
And yet you say our love means everything
Do you mean what you are saying
Or is this a little game you're playing?

My heart tells me I will cry again
Lips that kiss like yours could lie again
If I'm fool enough to see this through, will I
Be sorry if I do? Should I believe my heart or you?

My heart tells me I will cry again
'Cause lips that kiss like yours could lie again
If I'm fool enough to see this through, will I
Be sorry if I do? Should I believe my heart or you?"
In the Blue of Evening,['Asi Kaplan Jazz Band'],"In the blue of evening when you appear close to me, dear one
There in the dusk we'll share a dream reverie
In the blue of evening while crickets call and stars are falling
There 'neath the midnight sky you'll come to me
In the shadows of the night we'll stand, I'll touch your hand
And then, softly as your lovely eyes entreat, our lips will meet again
In the blue of evening, night winds above whisper I love you
There will we find romance in the blue of evening"
Taking A Chance On Love - Rechanneled Stereo Version,"['Benny Goodman', 'Label Copy Conversion/Sony Music Special Products Unknown']","Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.
I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.
I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love."
Comin' in on a Wing and a Prayer,['Ry Cooder'],"One of our planes was missing 
Two hours overdue 
One of our planes was missing 
With all its gallant crew 
The radio sets were humming 
We waited for a word 
Then a noise broke 
Through the humming and this is what we heard 

Comin' in on a wing and a prayer 
Comin' in on a wing and a prayer 
Though there's one motor gone 
We can still carry on 
Comin' in on a wing and a prayer 

What a show, what a fight, boys 
We really hit our target for tonight 
How we sing as we limp through the air 
Look below, there's our field over there 
With just one motor gone
We can still carry on 
Comin' in on a wing and a prayer 

Comin' in on a wing and a prayer 
Comin' in on a wing and a prayer 
With our full crew on board 
And our trust in the Lord 
We're comin' in on a wing and a prayer"
Why Don't You Fall in Love with Me,['Carroll Gibbons And The Savoy Hotel Orpheans'],"As long as you're not in love with anyone else,
Why don't you fall in love with me,
You're drivin' me crazy, baby, try to be gay
Will you tell me no, or will you tell me yea,
You gotta go overboard for someone someday
Believe it or not, it's bound to be
As long as you're not in love with anyone else,
Why don't you fall in love with me,"
Don't Get Around Much Anymore,['Duke Ellington'],"When I'm not playing solitaire
I take a book down from the shelf
And what with programs on the air
I keep pretty much to myself.
Missed the Saturday dance
Hear they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't Get Around Much Anymore
Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked about you
Don't Get Around Much Anymore
Darling I guess my mind's more at case
But nevertheless
Why stir up memories
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
Awf'lly diff'rent without you
Don't Get Around Much Anymore.
Missed the Saturday dance

It Can't Be Wrong,['Dick Haymes'],"Wrong
Would it be wrong to kiss
Seeing I feel like this
Would it be wrong to try?

Wrong
Would it be wrong to stay
Here in your arms this way
Under this starry sky?

If it is wrong
Then why were you sent to me
Why am I content to be
With you forever?

So
When I need you so much
And I have waited so long
It must be right
It can't be wrong"
All or Nothing at All,['Frank Sinatra'],"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all"
People Will Say We're In Love,"['Damon Daunno', 'Rebecca Naomi Jones']","Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors gossip all day behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue
Here is the gist, a practical list of dont's for you
Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love
Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love
Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove
Sweetheart, they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love
Some people claim that you are to blame as much as I
Why do you take the trouble to bake my favorite pie?
Grantin' your wish I carved our initials on that tree
Just keep a slice of all the advice ya give so free
Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love
Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love
Don't dance all night with me
'Til the stars fade from above
They'll see it's all right with me
People will say we're in love
Hey! If there's anybody out and around this yard that can hear my voice
I want 'em to know that Miss Laurey Williams is my girl!
Curly!
Hah-ha! And she went and got me to ask her to marry me!
They'll hear you all the way to Catoosie!
Let 'em!
Let people say we're in love
Who cares what happens now?
Just keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
Let people say we're in love
Starlight looks well on us
Let the stars beam from above
Who cares if they tell on us
Let people say we're in love"
They're Either Too Young or Too Old,['Sarah Spiegel'],"They're either too young, or too old
They're either too gray or too grassy green
The pickings are poor and the crop is lean
What's good is in the army
What's left will never harm me
They're either too old or too young
So, darling, you'll never get stung
Tomorrow I'll go hiking with that Eagle Scout unless
I get a call from grandpa for a snappy game of chess
I'll never, never fail ya
While you are in Australia
Or off among the Rooshians
And flying over Egypt
Your heart will never be gypped
And when you get to India
I'll still be what I've been to ya
I've looked the field over
And lo and behold
They're either too young or too old
They're either too bald or too bold
I'm down to the wheelchair and bassinet
My heart just refuses to get upset
I simply can't compel it to
With no Marine to tell it to
I'm either their first breath of spring
Or else, I'm their last little fling
I either get a fossil or an adolescent pup
I either have to hold him off
Or have to hold him up
The battle is on, but the fortress will hold
They're either too young or too old"
Shoo-Shoo Baby - Digitally Remastered '03,['The Andrews Sisters'],"You've seen him up and down the avenue
And now he's wearin' the navy blue
She had a tear in the corner of her eye
As he said his last goodbye
Shoo, shoo, shoo baby
Shoo, shoo, shoo baby
Bye, bye, bye baby
Do-dah do-day
Your papa's off to the seven seas
Don't cry, baby
Don't sigh, baby
Bye, bye, bye baby
Do-dah do-day
When I come back we'll live a life of ease
Seems kinda tough now
To say goodbye this way
But papa's gotta be rough now
So that he can be sweet to you another day
Bye, bye, bye baby
Don't cry, baby
Shoo, shoo, shoo baby
Do-dah do-day
Your papa's off to the seven seas
do-dah do-day
(Shhh-shoo baby) do-dah do-day
Quiet!
I want a little bit o' quiet in the house, please
(She wants a little bit of quiet in the house)
So your papa's on his way to cross the seven seas
So don't you cry, oh, don't you sigh goodbye now
Shoo, shoo baby shooo-oo-oo
Shoo, shoo my baby shooo
Goodbye baby, don't you cry no more
Your big tall papa's off to the seven seas
Seems kinda tough now
To say goodbye this way
But papa's gotta be rough now
So that he can be sweet to you another day
Shhh baby, shhh baby
Shoo, shoo, shoo baby
Goodbye, goodbye
Your papa's off to the seven seas, the seven seas
Your big tall papa's off to the seven seas"
As Time Goes By,['Dooley Wilson'],"You must remember this
A kiss is just a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say, ""I love you.""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate
Woman need man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate
Woman need man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by"
It Started All Over Again,['Frank Sinatra'],"It started all over again
The moment I looked in your eyes
It started all over again
The thrill we can never disguise

The day that we parted, so broken hearted
Will never return again
Dreams I've delayed, promises made
Are starting anew, just for you

It started all over again
The moment I held you so tight
It started all over again
When we kissed away the night - till dawn's early light

Now were together, sweethearts forever
We'll build our romance anew
It started all over again
The moment I looked at you"
Why Don't You Do Right?,"['Amy Irving', 'Charles Fleischer']","You had plenty money in nineteen twenty-two
You let other women make a fool of you
Why don't you do right like some other men do?
Get out of here, get me some money too

You're sittin' down wonderin' what it's all about
You ain't got no money they will put you out
Why don't you do right like some other men do?
Get out of here, get me some money too

If you had prepared twenty years ago
You wouldn't be wanderin' now from door to door
Why don't you do right like some other men do?
Get out of here, get me some money too

Why don't you do right like some other men do...?"
I'll Be Home for Christmas,['Kelly Clarkson'],"I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me 
Please have snow and, and mistletoe 
And presents under the tree

Christmas Eve will find you
Where the love light gleams 
I'll be home for Christmas 
If only in my dreams 

Christmas Eve will find me 
Where the love light gleams 
I'll be home for Christmas 
If only in my dreams"
You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To,"['Marisa Anderson', ""Tara Jane O'Neil""]","You'd be so nice to come home to
You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high sang a lullaby
You'd be all that I could desire
Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love
Under stars chilled by the winter
Under an August moon burning above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love"
Moonlight Becomes You,['Bing Crosby'],"Moonlight becomes you, it goes with your hair
You certainly know the right thing to wear
Moonlight becomes you, I'm thrilled at the sight
And I could get so romantic tonight

You're all dressed up to go dreaming
Now don't tell me I'm wrong
And what a night to go dreaming
Mind if I tag along?

If I say I love you
I want you to know
It's not just because there's moonlight
Although, moonlight becomes you so

You're all dressed up to go dreaming
Now don't tell me I'm wrong
And what a night to go dreaming
Mind if I tag along?

If I say I love you
I want you to know
It's not just because there's moonlight
Although, moonlight becomes you so"
For Me And My Gal,"['Judy Garland', 'Gene Kelly', 'David Rose And His Orchestra']","The bells are ringing for me and my gal,
The birds are singing for me and my gal.
Everybody's been knowing
To a wedding they're going
And for weeks they've been sewing,
Every Susie and Sal.
They're congregating for me and my gal,
The Parson's waiting for me and my gal.
And sometime
I'm goin' to build a little home for two,
For three or four or more,
In Love-land for me and my gal.

See the relatives there
Looking over the pair!
They can tell at a glance
It's a loving romance.

It's a wonderful sight
As the families unite.
Gee! It makes the boy proud
As he says to the crowd:

The bells are ringing for me and my gal,
The birds are singing for me and my gal.
Everybody's been knowing
To a wedding they're going
And for weeks they've been sewing,
Every Susie and Sal.
They're congregating for me and my gal,
The Parson's waiting for me and my gal.
And sometime

For three or four or more,
In Love-land for me and my gal."
I Heard You Cried Last Night (with Mark Warnow & The Hit Parade Orchestra),"['Frank Sinatra', 'Mark Warnow & The Hit Parade Orchestra']","I heard you cried last night and I know why
I heard you cried last night and so did I
Why did you make us part
I'm so alone, why did you take my heart
You didn't want it for your own
And if you hadn't cared to make amends
I might have never dared; we'd be just friends,
So calm your fears and dry your tears
Come kiss the boy you adore
Now you can smile tonight and cry no more."
Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,['The Andrews Sisters'],"He was a famous trumpet man from out Chicago way
He had a boogie style that no one else could play
He was the top man at his craft
But then his number came up and he was gone with the draft
He's in the army now, a-blowin' reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B

They made him blow a bugle for his Uncle Sam
It really brought him down because he couldn't jam
The captain seemed to understand
Because the next day the cap' went out and drafted a band
And now the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B

A-toot, a-toot, a-toot-diddelyada-toot
He blows it eight-to-the-bar, in boogie rhythm
He can't blow a note unless the bass and guitar is playin' with 'I'm
He makes the company jump when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B

He was our boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B
And when he plays boogie woogie bugle he was busy as a 'bzzz' bee
And when he plays he makes the company jump eight-to-the-bar
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B

Toot-toot-toot, toot-diddelyada, toot-diddelyada
Toot, toot, he blows it eight-to-the-bar
He can't blow a note if the bass and guitar isn't with 'I'm
A-a-a-and the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B

He puts the boys asleep with boogie every night
And wakes 'em up the same way in the early bright
They clap their hands and stamp their feet
Because they know how he plays when someone gives him a beat
He really breaks it up when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B

A-a-a-and the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of Company B"
Let's Get Lost,"['Kay Kyser & His Orch., vocals Harry, Julie, Trudy, Jack & Max']","Let's get lost, lost in each others arms
Let's get lost, let them send out alarms
And if they think we're rather rude
We'll tell the world we're in a crazy mood
Let's defrost, in a romantic mist
Let's get crossed, off everybody's list
We'll tell the world that we have found each other
Darling, let's get lost."
"Oh, What a Beautiful Morning","['Billy Porter', 'Pentatonix']","There's a bright golden haze on the meadow
There's a bright golden haze on the meadow
The corn is as high as an elephant's eye
And it looks like it's climbing clear up to the sky
Oh, what a beautiful mornin'
Oh, what a beautiful day
I've got a beautiful feeling
Everything's going my way
All the cattle are standing like statues
All the cattle are standing like statues
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by
But a little brown maverick is winking her eye
Oh, what a beautiful mornin'
I've got a beautiful feeling
Everything's going my way
All the sounds of the earth are like music
All the sounds of the earth are like music
The breeze is so busy, it don't miss a tree
And an old weeping willow is laughing at me
Oh, what a beautiful mornin'
Oh, what a beautiful day
I've got a beautiful feeling
Everything's going my way
Oh, what a beautiful day"
These Foolish Things,['Dick Haymes'],"A cigarette that bares a lipstick`s traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you.
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumblin`words That told you what my heart meant
A fairground`s painted swings
These foolish things
remind me of you.
You came,
You saw,
You conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March That made my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings But who`s to answer
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things
Remind me of you
First daffodils
And long excited cables
And candle lights
A little corner table
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening
When the bell has sounded
The pier in France
With all the gulls around it
The beauty that is spring
These foolish things
Remind me of you
How strange,
How sweet,
To find you still,
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains
At empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside
Dance invitations
Oh how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things
Remind me of you
Gardenia perfume
Lingering on a pillow
Wild strawberries
Only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings,
These foolish things,
Remind me of you
The smile of Garbo
And the scent of roses
The waiters whistling
As the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things
Remind me of you
How strange
How sweet
To find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smoldering leaves
The wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street
Who walk like dreamers
Oh how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things
Remind me of you."
How Deep Is The Ocean,['Dick Haymes'],"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
How many times in a day
Do I think of you?
How many roses are
Sprinkled with dew?
How far would I travel
Just to be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?
And if I ever lost you
How much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?"

"""Murder"" He Says",['Four Vagabonds'],"Finally found a fella almost completely divine

It's Always You,['Frank Sinatra'],"Whenever it's early twilight
I watch till a star breaks through
Funny, it's not a star I see
It's always you

Whenever I roam through roses
And lately I often do
Funny, it's not a rose I touch
It's always you

If a breeze caresses me
It's really you strolling by

You dare me to be untrue
Funny, each time I fall in love
It's always you"
Victry Polka,['Harry James'],"There's going to be a Hallelujah Day
When the boys have all come home to stay

In each blacked out land across the sea
When a man can proudly say 'I'm free'
We'll be dancing ""The Vict'ry Polka.""
And we will give a mighty cheer
When the ration book is just a souvenir.
And we'll heave a mighty sigh
When each gal can kiss the boy she kissed good-bye.
And they'll come marching down Fifth Avenue

When this lovely dream has all come true.
We'll be dancing ""The Vict'ry Polka.""
Dance, dance, dance ""The Vict'ry Polka.""
Join, join the merry throng.
Sing, sing, sing ""The Vict'ry Polka.""
Raise your voices loud and strong.
There's going to be a great Hallelujah Day
When the boys have all come home to stay
And a million bands begin to play.
We'll be dancing ""The Vict'ry Polka.""
And when we've lit the torch of liberty
In each blacked out land across the sea.
When a man can proudly say 'I'm free'
We'll be dancing ""The Vict'ry Polka.""

In My Arms,"['Dick Haymes & The Song Spinners', 'Dick Haymes']","His cousin had sent him a sweater
And his sister wrote a letter
But he wanted something much better
This boy who was sailing away
For his buddies were with their sweethearts
All around him with their sweethearts
Now he'd never had any sweethearts
And over and over he'd say

In my arms, in my arms
Ain't I never gonna have a girl in my arms
In my arms, in my arms
Ain't I never gonna get a bundle of charms
Comes the dawn, I'll be gone
I just gotta have a honey holdin' me tight
You can keep your knittin' and purlin'
If I'm gonna go to Berlin
Gimme a girl in my arms tonight

His grandma had sent him some candy
And as he chewed on the candy
He said my morale is just dandy
And still there's a tear in my eye
For his buddies were there with their sweethearts
Kissing bye-bye with their sweethearts
Now he'd never had any sweethearts
And over and over he'd cry

In my arms, in my arms
Ain't I never gonna have a girl in my arms
In my arms, in my arms
Ain't I never gonna get a bundle of charms
Comes the dawn, I'll be gone
And I thank you for the many letters you'll write
As for something nice and cute and female
I'll never get it in the V-mail
Gimme a girl in my arms tonight

In my arms, in my arms
Ain't I never gonna have a girl in my arms
In my arms, in my arms
Ain't I never gonna get a bundle of charms
Comes the dawn, I'll be gone
I'll be headin' for the very thick of the fight
You can wine and dine and cigarette me
But if you really wanna get me
Gimme a girl in my arms tonight

In my arms, in my arms
Ain't I never gonna have a girl in my arms
In my arms, in my arms
Ain't I never gonna get a bundle of charms
Comes the dawn, I'll be gone
Now does anyone wanna please treat me right
You can keep your shavin' cream and lotion
If I'm a-gonna cross the ocean
Give me a girl in my arms tonight"

Let's get crossed, off everybodys list
We'll tell the world that we have found each other

That Old Black Magic,['Ella Fitzgerald'],"That old black magic's got me in its spell
That old black magic that you weave so well
Those icy fingers
Up and down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine

The same old tingle that I feel inside
And when that elevator starts its ride
Darling down and down I go, round and round I go
Like a leaf that's
Caught in the tide

I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name, and I'm aflame
Aflame with
Such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

You're the lover
You're the lover
You're the lover
You're the lover
I have waited for

The mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine

Darling down and down I go
Round and Round I go
In a spin, I'm loving the spin that I'm in
I'm Under that old black magic called love

Yes I'm in a spin, I'm loving the spin I'm in
I'm under that old black magic called love
Got me spinning and spinning and spinning around
Like an elevator's going down
In this magic, black magic called love"
Close To You - Remastered,['Frank Sinatra'],"Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of golden starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true

Don't Cry Baby,['Erskine Hawkins'],"I just needed someone, somebody to hold
When the bottle was empty
And the nights grew cold
In my hour of darkness
In my time of need
You were my angel of mercy
And helped me to believe
You touched my soul
When I was lonely
You held me up
When I couldn't fly
There's no words could explain
How I feel inside
And this I tell you
In a world full of anger
In times gone strange
You held me close
You held me close to you
Lay my head on your shoulder
I finally let it all out
It felt good for a moment
Not living in a shadow of doubt
But everybody needs a little something
To pull them through
I gave one for the other
And God know that the other was you
Now only time will tell
Only time will tell
If our love is scratched in sand
Or if it's etched in stone
Only time will tell
Only time will tell
If our love will stand
Or walk the road alone
My angel of mercy
Pulled me through somehow
I just hope you know
I need you now
You're the one
That touched my very soul
The one who held on tight
God knows you never let go
Now only time will tell
Only time will tell
If our love is scratched in sand
Or if it's etched in stone
Only time will tell
Only time will tell
If our love will stand
Or walk the road alone
Only time will
Only time will
Only time will tell
(Can you teach my soul to fly)
Only time will
Only time will
(Can you save me)
Only time will tell

It's time we closed the door
Put out the lights
And burn the fire
Burn the fire inside

My Ideal,"['Billy Butterfield', 'Margaret Whiting']","Long ago my heart and mind
Got together and designed
The wonderful girl for me
Oh what a fantasy
Thought the ideal of my heart
Can't be ordered a la carte
I wonder if she will be
Always a fantasy
Will I ever find the girl in my mind?
The one who is my ideal
Maybe she's a dream and yet she might be
Just around the corner waiting for me
Will I recognize the light in her eyes
That no other eyes reveal
Or will I pass her by and never even know
That she was my ideal
Will I recognize the light in her eyes
That no other eyes reveal
Or will I pass her by and never even know
That she is my ideal"

When you smile on me, the world is mine
And the dreams I dream, I know will all come true
Every care becomes divine
Waiting all for you

My heart is beating to the old refrain
When I'm alone with you
My heart's repeating, ""I'm in love again""
Can't we hold a rendezvous?

You're the dreams I dream, the song I sing
You're the stars and moon and nearly everything
Life would be a symphony
Waiting all for you

With you forever?

And I have waited so long
It must be right

To hear the echo of your sighs

I never mention your name, oh no
I never ache for your kiss
I never turn all the lights down low
To let the shadows reminisce

I never wait by the fire

I never feel the slightest desire
To hold you when it's night again

I never mention your name, oh no
I never know you're away
Except for every minute of every hour
Of every night and day

Mighty soon he was making it tick
He made it tick with a beautiful beat:
It ticks a wham, a ree-bop, a tick tock

Have way to nowhere
Where the trains just stop to take on water

But she makes my whole world sunny
Where's no make up on her face
But where she is, well, that's my place
And I'm going home to my girl.

For a bore making gird
And it's hard to keep your sense of values
And to do things you should
Girls come easy, try to make you

When the city dulls my eyes
Then I'll remember summer skies
And dream of the grace I belong

And you were meant to be my heart's delight,
Not just tonight but constantly."

When I jump in my shower each morn'
Sure as fate, I'm too late,
All the hot water is gone

I get that burnt piece of toast
I get that seat in the movies
Smacko! in back of the post
That's why I can't get over this dream that came true
If I get the neck of the chicken
How did I ever get you?
I get the neck of the chicken
That's how they give me the bird
And in the family snapshot
Mine is the face that's all blurred
When morning paper comes to the door
Sure as fate, I'm too late
And they're mine long about four
I get the neck of the chicken
I get the plate with the crack
I get those evenings with Granma
Everyone else can relax
That's why I can't get over this fine howdy-do
If I get the neck of the chicken
How did I ever get you?"

Though I realize I'm crippled, that is true sir,
Please don't judge my courage by my twisted leg,
let me show my Uncle Sam what I can do, sir,
let me help to bring the Axis down a peg.

and a hero brave is what I want to be,

In that heaven there should be a place for me."

Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold, let's go on with the show

Get paid for what they do but no applause.

Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's no attack
Where could you get money that you don't give back? Let's go on with the show
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on
Yesterday they told you you would not go far, that night you open and there you are
Next day on your dressing room they've hung a star, let's go on with the show!!"
Doin' What Comes Naturally,['Ethel Merman'],"Folks are dumb,
Where I come from,
They ain't had any learnin'
Still, they're happy as can be,
Doin' what comes naturally.
Folks like us,
Could never fuss,
With schools and books and learnin',
Still we've gone from A to Z,
Doin' what comes naturally.
You don't have to know,
How to read or write,
When you're out with a feller,
In the pale moonligt,
You don't have to look,
At a book to find,
What he thinks of the moon,
And what is on his mind,
That comes naturally.
My uncle out in Texas,
Can't even write his name,
He signs his checks with ""X's"",
But they cash 'em just the same.
If you saw my Paw and Maw,
You'd know they had no learnin',
Still they raised a family,
Doin' what comes naturally,
Doin' what comes naturally!"
I Lost My Sugar In Salt Lake City,"['Johnny Mercer', 'Freddie Slack And His Orchestra']","I lost my sugar in Salt Lake City
Oh, why did I go there
I should have stayed down in New Orleans
And never gone nowhere
A girl with sweet talk from Kansas City
Her words were sweet like wine
She bought him diamonds and limousines
She stole that man o' mine
When night comes a-creepin'
For me there's no sleeping
What she sews, she'll be reapin'
'Cause she done me wrong
I cried my heart out in Salt Lake City
The day I heard the news
He left me deep in my solitude
With a Salt Lake City blues
With a Salt Lake City blues"

It's easy to see,
You don't need a palace,
To feel like Alice,
In wonderland.

Where I come from,
I've done a lot of dreamin' an I've traveled some,
But I never thought I'd see the day,
When I ever took a ride on The Santa Fe.

I would lean across my window sill,
And hear the whistle echoin across the hill,
Then I'd watch the lights, till they fade away,
On the Atchison, Topeka, and The Santa Fe.

What a thrill,
(What a great big wonderful thrill).
With the wheels a singin' westward ho,
Right from the day I heard them start.
Cross the Kansas plains from New Mexico,
I guess I've got a little gypsy in my heart.

When I'm old and gray and settled down,
If I ever get a chance to sneak away from town,
Then I'll spend my busmen's holiday,
On The Atchison, Topeka, and The Santa Fe.

(All aboard)!
All aboard!

I can't believe I'm here at last.
I can't believe that anything could go so fast.

A huffin and a puffin and a way she goes.

I never saw rainbows in my wine

Yes, yes, yes, hubba-hubba
Bop, bop, bop, hubba-hubba
A what you kno' A what you kno'
A what you say A what you say
I say I'll dig you later baby in the USA"
"If I Loved You - From the Musical Production ""Carousel""",['Perry Como'],"But somehow I can see
Just exactly how I'd be
If I loved you,
Time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know.
If I loved you,
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go!
Longin' to tell you,
But afraid and shy,
I'd let my golden chances pass me by!
Soon you'd leave me,
Off you would go in the mist of day,
Never, never to know how I loved you
If I loved you.
Well, anyway, you mean you don't love me.
That's what you said, isn't it?
Yes!
I can smell 'em, can you, ah?
The blossoms. The wind brings 'em down!
Billy there ain't much wind tonight
Hardly any.
You can't hear a sound, not the turn of a leaf
Nor the fall of a wave hittin' the sand.
The tide's creepin' up on the beach like a thief,
Afraid to be caught stealin' the land!
On a night like this I start to wonder
What life is all about.
And I always say two heads are better than one to
figure it out.
I don't need you, I don't need anybody helpin' me.
Well, I got it figured out for myself.
We're not important. What are we?
A couple o' specks with nothin'
Look up there
There's a hell of a lotta stars in the sky,
And the sky's so big the sea looks small,
And two little people, you and I
We don't count at all.
You're a funny kid, you know?
I don't remember meetin' a girl like you.
Hey, you're tryin' to get me to marry you?
No!
Then what's puttin' into my head, babe?
You're diff'rent, alright! I know what it is...
You have doped me with that little kid's face, right?
You've adjusted me!
I wonder what it'd be like
What?
Nothin'.
No, I know what it'd be like.
It'd be awful! I can just see myself-
Kinda scrawny, and pale
Picking at my food,
And love-sick like any other guy.
I'd throw away my sweater, and dress up like a dude
In a dicky and a collar and a tie.
If I loved you.
But you don't!
No, I don't!
But somehow I can see
Just exactly how I'd be
If I loved you,
Time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know.
If I loved you,
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go!
Longin' to tell you,
But afraid and shy
I'd let my golden chances pass me by!
Soon you'd leave me,
Off you would go in the mist of day,
Never, never to know
How I loved you
If I loved you.
Aha I'm not the kinda fella to marry anybody!
No, even if a girl was foolish enough to want me to,
I wouldn't!
Don't worry about it, Billy!

Who's worried?

You were right about there bein' no wind.
The blossoms are comin' down by theirselves.
Just they're in time to, I reckon."
Till the End of Time,['Dick Haymes'],"Till the end of time, long as stars are in the blue
Long as there's a Spring of birds to sing I'll go on loving you
Till the end of time, long as roses bloom in May
My love for you will grow deeper with every passing day
Till the wells run dry and each mountain disappears
I'll be there for you to care for you through laughter and through tears
So take my heart in sweet surrender and tenderly say that I'm
The one you love and live for till the end of time
Till the wells run dry and each mountain disappears
I'll be there for you to care for you through laughter and through tears
So take my heart in sweet surrender and tenderly say that I'm
The one you love and live for till the end of time"
