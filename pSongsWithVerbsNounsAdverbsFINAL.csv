0,Just a Baby's Prayer at Twilight,['Henry Burr'],"(Verse)
I've heard the prayers of mothers
Some of them old and gray
I've heard the prayers of others
For those who went away
Oft times a prayer will teach one
The meaning of goodbye
I've felt the pain of each one
But this one made me cry

(Pre-Chorus)
Just a baby's prayer at twilight
When lights are low
Her baby's years, are filled with tears
There's mother there at twilight
Who's proud to know
Her precious little tot
Is Dad's forget-me-not
After saying ""Goodnight, Mama""
She climbs upstairs
Quite unaware
And says her prayer

(Chorus)
""Oh, kindly tell my daddy that he must take care""
That's a baby's prayer at twilight
For her daddy, over there

(Instrumental)

3,Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning,['Matt Cherne'],"The other day I chanced to meet a soldier friend of mine,
he'd been in camp for sevral weeks and he was looking fine;
His muscles had developed and his cheeks were rosy red,
I asked him how he liked the life, and this is what he said:
Oh! how I hate to get up in the morning,
Oh! how Id love to remain in bed;
For the hardest blow of all, is to hear the bugler call;
you've got to get up, you've got to get up, you've got to get up this morning!
Some day I'm going to murder the bugler,
Some day they're going to find him dead;
Ill amputate his reveille, and step upon it heavily,
And spend the rest of my life in bed.
Oh! how I hate to get up in the morning,
Oh! how Id love to remain in bed;
For the hardest blow of all, is to hear the bugler call;
you've got to get up, you've got to get up, you've got to get up this morning!
Oh! boy the minute the battle is over,
Oh! boy the minute the foe is dead;
I'll put my uniform away, and move to Philadelphia,
And spend the rest of my life in bed.
A bugler in the army is the luckiest of men,
He wakes the boys at five and then goes back to bed again;
He doesn't have to blow again until the afternoon,
If evry thing goes well with me I'll be a bugler soon.
Oh! how I hate to get up in the morning,
Oh! how Id love to remain in bed;
For the hardest blow of all, is to hear the bugler call;
you've got to get up, you've got to get up, you've got to get up this morning!
Some day I'm going to murder the bugler,
Some day they're going to find him dead;

5,I'm All Bound 'Round with the Mason-Dixon Line,['Rosy McHargue & Friends'],"My daddy courted my Mammy, away down South; 
they married in Alabammy, away down South; 
and when I came into this world, old Dixie gave me birth, 
that's why I claim that Dixie is the finest place on earth. 
They brought me up in sunny Caroline, 
and they just planted Dixie in the heart of mine.

Last night I lay awake thinking of Dixie land; 
thinking of Abraham Lincoln, and Dixie land; 
he surely loved the stars and stripes, the Southern and the North, 
and his poor heart was broken when the loyal sons marched forth. 
Why no one loved old Dixie more than he, 
excepting that it might have been poor little me.

I'm all abound round with the Mason Dixon Line; 
it's pulling me, back where I used to be; 
when I was younger I knew every lane. 
Now I hunger to be once again; 
back where the robin keeps throbbing pretty melodies; 
and when I'm all bound round with a pair of loving arms, 
Oh! mother mine! I'll know I'm in Caroline; 
I've read a lot about Heaven, but give me Dixie all the time; 
for I've found that I'm bound, bound all around, with the Mason Dixon Line.

I'm leaving you today,
Don't cry dear,

When I come back to you,
We will build
A little home for two.
Then we'll settle down, dear, for life,
Far away from care and strife.
Cheer up dear, and when I'm far away,
Don't forget to write each day.

Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?
I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage
And each must play a part.
Fate had me playing in love you as my sweet heart.
Act one was when we met, I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two, you seemed to change and you acted strange
And why I'll never know.
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you.
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than go on living without you.
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then make them bring the curtain down.

In my garden of love

A pine tree for the way I pined over you
And an ash for the day I ashed you to be true

Now thereÕs a palm tree that we planted when we had our first date
A turnip for the way you always used to turnip late
Your mother and your cousin, Chris, they often used to come
So, in their honour, I have raised a nice chris-anÕ-the-mum

(Chorus) And the sunð.

Now thereÕs a beetroot for the day you said that youÕd beetroot to me
A sweet pea for the sweet way you always smiled at me
But you had friends who needed you 
There was Ferdy, there was Liza
So, just for them, I put down a load of ferdy-liza

(Chorus) And the sunð.

But Gus the gardenerÕs left now and you went with him, too
The fungus there reminds me of the fun Gus is having with you

Jimmy's mother went to see her son
Marching along on parade
In his uniform and with his gun
What a lovely picture he made
She came home that evening
Filled up with delight
And to all the neighbors
She would yell with all her might

""Did you see my little Jimmy marching
With the soldiers up the avenue?
There was Jimmy just as stiff as starch
Just like his father on the seventeenth o' March
Did you notice all the lovely ladies
Casting their eyes at him?
Away he went
To live in a tent
Over in France with his regiment
Were you there, and tell me, did you notice?
They were all out of step but Jim""

Buying the drinks for the crowd
You could tell that he was feeling good
He was talking terribly loud
Twenty times he treated
My, but he was dry
When his glass was empty
He would treat again and cry

32,Where the Morning Glories Grow,['Dear Nora'],"I remember, I remember
The place where I was born
Where the morning glories twine
Around the door at early morn

I've forgotten, I've forgotten
How long I've been away
But I'd like to wander back again
Down the lane to yesterday

I want to wake up in the morning
Where the morning glories grow
Where the sun comes peeping in
Where I'm sleeping and the songbirds say, ""Hello""

I long to wander in the wild wood
Where the rippling waters flow
And go drifting back to childhood
Where the morning glories grow

I remember, I remember
The schoolhouse on the hill
And I wonder if the tiny folks
Are climbing up there still

I can picture, I can picture
The dear old swimming pool
And the happy days that I spent there
When I should have been in school

I want to wake up in the morning
Where the morning glories grow
Where the sun comes peeping in
Where I'm sleeping and the songbirds say, ""Hello""

I long to wander in the wild wood

34,Roses Of Picardy,['Alfie Boe'],"She is watching by the poplars
Colinette with the sea-blue eyes
She is watching and longing, and waiting
Where the long white roadway lies
And a song stirs in the silence
As the wind in the boughs above
She listens and starts and trembles
'Tis the first little song of love

Roses are shining in Picardy
In the hush of the silver dew
Roses are flowering in Picardy
But there's never a rose like you!
And the roses will die with the summertime
And our roads may be far apart
But there's one rose that dies not in Picardy
'Tis the rose that I keep in my heart

And the years fly on forever
Till the shadows veil their skies
But he loves to hold her little hands
And look into her sea-blue eyes
And she sees the road by the poplars
Where they met in the bygone years
For the first little song of the roses
Is the last little song she hears:

Roses are shining in Picardy
In the hush of the silver dew
Roses are flowering in Picardy

Jim was at the garden gate

YouÕre the kind of a girl that men forget
Just a toy to enjoy for a while
For when men settle down
They get an old fashioned girl
With an old fashioned smile
And youÕll soon realize youÕre not so wise
When the years bring you tears of regret
When they play ÒHere comes the brideÓ

ThereÕs a lad who is true To the Red, White and Blue, And heÕs serving his Flag oÕer the sea. But it does not reflect golden sunshine, Never gleams in the dead of night
In the brightness of day, As the night wears away, It shines with its own holy light. [Refrain] There are stars in the high heavens shining With a promise of hope in their light. There are stars in the field of Old Glory, The emblem of honor and right. But no star ever shone with more brightness, I know, Than the one for my boy oÕer the sea
ThereÕs a little blue star in the window, And it means all the world to me.

39,Indianola,['Charlie Robison'],"My little brother was just ten years old
When we hit bad weather and hid in the hole
We could see Texas was only a mile
And oh, little brother, I remember your smile
At Indianola

My dad built a sawmill of cypreses and stone
It was here on Madena that we made our home
The year 1850 and I sent for my girl
Oh Frauline, come meet me in this brand new world
At Indianola

The war they call civil had barely begun
Me and my cousins decided we'd run
Up through Louisianan to meet up with Grant
But one hundred damn rebels shot us there in the sand
At Indianola

They said up in New York, the stock market fell
And the life they was livin' was shot all to hell
But we ain't seen nothin' no different than dust
Sept the wheels on the wagon all covered with rust
At Indianola

And that scrape with old Hitler was over and done
And I wondered if I could kill kin with my gun
But we sat there in Paris in a little cafÃ©
And as they toasted Truman, I drifted away
To Indianola

But it's fifty years later and nobody cares
About some old city that ain't even there
Well, my sons moved to Houston
And they work in the Gulf
With seven days on and seven days off

Well I work for the doctor that bought our old ranch
From first quality federal the foreclosures branch
And he calls me hillbilly and he laughs at my hair
But the cancer will get him if anything's fair

And I'll take his ashes and throw from my boat
As they crossed that ocean I'm going to float
To find me another Indianola

WhatÕs that tune I hear? A ringing in my ear
Come on along, come on along, ItÕs a wonderful idea
ItÕs AlexanderÕs band, from down in Dixieland
HeÕs going Òover thereÓ to do his share

[Chorus]
When Alexander takes his ragtime band to France
HeÕll capture evÕry Hun, and take them one by one
Those ragtime tunes will put the Germans in a trance
TheyÕll throw their guns away, hip hip hooray!
And start right in to dance
TheyÕll get so excited theyÕll come over the top
Two step back to Berlin with a skip and a hop
Old Hindenburg will know he has no chance
When Alexander takes his ragtime band to France

[Verse 2]
ThereÕs no time to lose, theyÕll put on dancing shoes
TheyÕll glide away, and slide away
When they hear those weary blues
The goose stepÕs on the wane, the two stepÕs in again
Like they advanced at first, theyÕve just reversed

When on the world the mists began to fall,

Low to our hearts love sang an old sweet song
And in the dusk where fell the firelight gleam
Softly it wove itself into our dream
Just a song at twilight
When the lights are low,
And the flickering shadows
Softly come and go
Though the heart be weary,
Sad the day and long,
Still to us at twilight comes love's old song
Comes love's old sweet song.
Even today we hear love's song of yore
Deep in our hearts it dwells forever more
Footsteps may falter, weary grows our way
Still we can hear it at the close of day
So till the end when life's dim shadows fall
Love will be found the sweetest song of all.
Just a song at twilight

And the flickering shadows

51,A Precious Little Thing Called Love,['Irving Kaufman'],"Why does my heart miss a beat
At some footsteps on the street
It's a precious little thing called love

Why am I content alone
When I know someone will phone
It's a precious little thing called love

I see a day in June, a wedding tune
A honeymoon cruise
Friends I know who will throw
Some rice and old shoes

What's the one thing makes me say
Heaven's just across the way
It's a precious little thing called love

(Instrumental Break)

I was on my way to Dr. Cupid
I was all upset, I was in doubt
Suddenly I laughed with glee
There was nothing wrong with me
For I guessed what it was all about

Oh, nunna-nunna, oh, nunna-nunna-nunna
I do, I do, I do-do-do
That precious thing called love

It's so hard to concentrate
I don't even know the date
It's a precious little thing that they call love

I see a day in June, a wedding tune
A honeymoon cruise

And I found I had a date
At half past eight
I can't be late!
Look me over
How do I look?
Now tell me
Am I there?
Tell me on the square
Could I make anyone care?
I comb my hair
Brush my hat
I even wash
My dog and cat!
Tonight's my night with baby
The onions that
I like so much
For weeks I haven't
Dared to touch!
Tonight's my night with baby
Now I call sweetie ""baby""
And here's the reason why
Every time we cuddle
It works just like a lullaby!
I hear the parson in the hall
For we'd be there if I should fall!
Tonight's my night with baby
Feels just like I'm walkin' on wheels
I feel that I could fly!
Look in my eye
And you'll see why!
Just had rubber
Put on my heels
I've no time to lose!
Do your duty, shoes!
I'm run 'way from the blues!
If she says ""yes""
Then I'll say ""yes""
If she says ""no""
I'll still say ""yes""!
Tonight's my night with baby
And If she says ""do""
I'll say ""do""
If she says ""don't""
I'll do say ""do"", ha!
Tonight's my night with baby
We'll move to the north pole
I know that we're not wrong
You know, at the north pole
The nights up there are six months long!
I guess she's nice, I hope I'm right
But if I'm wrong I'll know tonight!
Tonight's my night with baby
I got my ma
Got my pa
I put 'em on my motor car!
Tonight's my night with baby
And I said to my driver, ""Jack
Just drive and drive and don't come back!""
'Cause tonight's my night with baby

63,Livery Stable Blues,['Original Dixieland Jazz Band'],"Listen to your heart,
Listen to the clock,
Listen to the train.
A heart's got rhythm,
A clock's got rhythm,
A train's got rhythm.
You gotta have rhythm
to clap your hands,
You gotta have rhythm
to tap your feet,
You gotta have rhythm
to understand
What makes jazz is a good downbeat!
Your heart starts pumpin',
Your feet start stompin',
The whole world's jumpin';
You feel like bustin' outta your skin,
It's jazz that's got you in a spin,
You feel you've got the world
in your hand --
Jazz can really make you understand.
A rollercoaster in the sky,
A red-hot trumpet's lullabye,
A lamppost on a rainy night,
A lonesome white electric light;
A brand-new pair of golden shoes,
A bullfrog singin' out the blues --
It's all connected with a beat

Some Sunday morning is goin' to be
Some Sunday morning for someone and me!
Bells will be chimimg an old melody,
'Specially for someone and me!

[dh]
There'll be an organ playing,
Friends and relations will stare.
Say, can't you hear 'em saying,
""Gee, what a beautiful pair!""?

[hf]
Some Sunday morning, we'll walk down the aisle,
You'll be so nervous and I'll try to smile!
[dh]
Things sure look rosy for someone and me,
Some Sunday morning, you'll see!

65,I Hate to Lose You,['The Savoy Quartet'],"I hate to lose you,
I'm so used to you now,
Still I excuse you
For breaking your vow.

Just like the sunlight, I've found
I'm used to havin' you 'round.
You're all I've ever been thinkin' of,
Who am I gonna love,
Now that you've turned me down?

Just like the rose, dear,
That's used to the sun,
Its petals close, dear,
When Summer is done.

And I'm so used to your kisses, all the others seem strange,
Used to your lovin' and I don't wanna change.
I hate to lose you,
I'm so used to you now!
