Just a Baby's Prayer at Twilight,['Henry Burr'],"(Verse)
I've heard the prayers of mothers
Some of them old and gray
I've heard the prayers of others
For those who went away
Oft times a prayer will teach one
The meaning of goodbye
I've felt the pain of each one
But this one made me cry

(Pre-Chorus)
Just a baby's prayer at twilight
When lights are low
Her baby's years, are filled with tears
There's mother there at twilight
Who's proud to know
Her precious little tot
Is Dad's forget-me-not
After saying ""Goodnight, Mama""
She climbs upstairs
Quite unaware
And says her prayer

(Chorus)
""Oh, kindly tell my daddy that he must take care""
That's a baby's prayer at twilight
For her daddy, over there

(Instrumental)

(Chorus)
""Oh, kindly tell my daddy that he must take care""
That's a baby's prayer at twilight
For her daddy, over there"
Rock-A-Bye Your Baby With A Dixie Melody,['Jerry Lewis'],"Rock-a-bye your baby with a Dixie melody ‚Äì
When you croon
Croon a tune
From the heart of Dixie!

Just hang my cradle, mammy mine
Right on the Mason Dixon line
And swing it from Virginia
To Tennessee with all the love that's in ya!

Weep no more, weep no more, my lady
Sing that song again for me
So soft and low, just as though
You had me on your knee!

A million baby kisses, that I would deliver
The minute that you sing the Swanee River ‚Äì
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby with a Dixie melody!

Oh, weep no more, my lady
Sing that song again for me
So soft and low
Just as though
You had me on your knee!

A million baby kisses, that I would deliver
The minute that you sing the Swanee River ‚Äì
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby with a Dixie melody!"
I'm Always Chasing Rainbows - Single Version,['Judy Garland'],"I'm always chasing rainbows
Watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams
Ending in the sky
Some fellows look and find the sunshine
I always look and find the rain
Some fellows make a winning sometime
I never even make a gain, believe me
I'm always chasing rainbows
Waiting to find a little bluebird in vain
Some fellows look and find the sunshine
But I always look and find the rain
Some fellows make a winning sometime
I never even make a gain, believe me
I'm always chasing rainbows
Waiting to find a little bluebird in vain"
Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning,['Matt Cherne'],"The other day I chanced to meet a soldier friend of mine,
he'd been in camp for sevral weeks and he was looking fine;
His muscles had developed and his cheeks were rosy red,
I asked him how he liked the life, and this is what he said:
Oh! how I hate to get up in the morning,
Oh! how Id love to remain in bed;
For the hardest blow of all, is to hear the bugler call;
you've got to get up, you've got to get up, you've got to get up this morning!
Some day I'm going to murder the bugler,
Some day they're going to find him dead;
Ill amputate his reveille, and step upon it heavily,
And spend the rest of my life in bed.
Oh! how I hate to get up in the morning,
Oh! how Id love to remain in bed;
For the hardest blow of all, is to hear the bugler call;
you've got to get up, you've got to get up, you've got to get up this morning!
Oh! boy the minute the battle is over,
Oh! boy the minute the foe is dead;
I'll put my uniform away, and move to Philadelphia,
And spend the rest of my life in bed.
A bugler in the army is the luckiest of men,
He wakes the boys at five and then goes back to bed again;
He doesn't have to blow again until the afternoon,
If evry thing goes well with me I'll be a bugler soon.
Oh! how I hate to get up in the morning,
Oh! how Id love to remain in bed;
For the hardest blow of all, is to hear the bugler call;
you've got to get up, you've got to get up, you've got to get up this morning!
Some day I'm going to murder the bugler,
Some day they're going to find him dead;
Ill amputate his reveille, and step upon it heavily,
And spend the rest of my life in bed.
Oh! how I hate to get up in the morning,
Oh! how Id love to remain in bed;
For the hardest blow of all, is to hear the bugler call;
you've got to get up, you've got to get up, you've got to get up this morning!
Oh! boy the minute the battle is over,
Oh! boy the minute the foe is dead;
I'll put my uniform away, and move to Philadelphia,
And spend the rest of my life in bed."
"Hail, Hail the Gang's All Here",['Frank 88 Malone'],"Well the devil's nipping at your heels and this time it's for real
A lonely hunger starts to gnaw as you wish away the pain
Of another desperate dead end day forever filled with sadness
To forget about the pain you take your bottle, drink your grave

[Chorus]
Singing Hail, Hail, the Gangs All Here
Leave your worries at the door boy, they're not going anywhere
Hail, hail the gang's all here
When the going gets tough, I know my friends will still be there
Well you're walking down the road and the wind is in your face
You're down and out and the unemployment line's a mile long
The money in your pocket may not get you through the day
But cheer up son I know a place where mugs like us belong

[Chorus]
Pick your heart up off the ground though I'm sure it weights a ton
You're no better or no worse than any mothers son
Though you're up against all odds and you're backed against the wall
You recall the cheer, ""The Gang's All Here"" and shout!"
I'm All Bound 'Round with the Mason-Dixon Line,['Rosy McHargue & Friends'],"My daddy courted my Mammy, away down South; 
they married in Alabammy, away down South; 
and when I came into this world, old Dixie gave me birth, 
that's why I claim that Dixie is the finest place on earth. 
They brought me up in sunny Caroline, 
and they just planted Dixie in the heart of mine.

Last night I lay awake thinking of Dixie land; 
thinking of Abraham Lincoln, and Dixie land; 
he surely loved the stars and stripes, the Southern and the North, 
and his poor heart was broken when the loyal sons marched forth. 
Why no one loved old Dixie more than he, 
excepting that it might have been poor little me.

I'm all abound round with the Mason Dixon Line; 
it's pulling me, back where I used to be; 
when I was younger I knew every lane. 
Now I hunger to be once again; 
back where the robin keeps throbbing pretty melodies; 
and when I'm all bound round with a pair of loving arms, 
Oh! mother mine! I'll know I'm in Caroline; 
I've read a lot about Heaven, but give me Dixie all the time; 
for I've found that I'm bound, bound all around, with the Mason Dixon Line.

"Hello Central, Give Me No Man's Land (World War I Song) (1918)",['Al Jolson'],"When the gray shadows creep
And the world is asleep
In the still of the night
Baby climbs down a flight
First she looks all around
Without making a sound
Then baby toddles up to the telephone
And whispers in a baby tone

""Hello, Central, give me No Man's Land
My Daddy's there, my Mama told me;
She tip-toed off to bed
After my prayers were said;
Don't ring when you get the number
Or you'll disturb Mama's slumber

I'm afraid to stand here at the 'phone
'Cause I'm alone
So won't you hurry;
I want to know why Mama starts to weep
When I say, 'Now I lay me down to sleep'
Hello, Central, give me No Man's Land""

Over There (Par l√†-bas),"['George M. Cohan', 'Enrico Caruso', 'Josef Pasternack']","Johnnie, get your gun,
Get your gun, get your gun,
Take it on the run,
On the run, on the run.
Hear them calling, you and me,
Every son of liberty.
Hurry right away,
No delay, go today,
Make your daddy glad
To have had such a lad.
Tell your sweetheart not to pine,
To be proud her boy's in line. 

Over there, over there,
Send the word, send the word over there -
That the Yanks are coming,
The Yanks are coming,
The drums rum-tumming
Everywhere.
So prepare, say a prayer,
Send the word, send the word to beware.
We'll be over, we're coming over,
And we won't come back till it's over
Over there.

Johnnie, get your gun,
Get your gun, get your gun,
Johnnie show the Hun
Who's a son of a gun.
Hoist the flag and let her fly,
Yankee Doodle do or die.
Pack your little kit,
Show your grit, do your bit.
Yankee to the ranks,
From the towns and the tanks.
Make your mother proud of you,
And the old Red, White and Blue. 

Over there, over there,
Send the word, send the word over there -
That the Yanks are coming,
The Yanks are coming,
The drums rum-tumming

So prepare, say a prayer,
Send the word, send the word to beware.

Say a Prayer for Our Boys Over There (with Henry Burr) [Recorded 1918],['The Peerless Quartet'],"Say a prayer for the boys over there
When they play the Star Spangled Banner
Picture them by the dawn's early light
And ask the Lord to watch over them each night.

Lift your eyes as you silently rise
When they play the Star Spangled Banner
As the song of freedom fills the air
Say a prayer for the boys over there.

All of us are working hand in hand
We're working to preserve this wonderous land
But there is something more we all can do
That will help to bring our loved ones safely through.

Say a prayer for the boys over there
When they play the Star Spangled Banner
Picture them by the dawn's early light
And ask the Lord to watch over them each night.

Lift your eyes as you silently rise
When they play the Star Spangled Banner
As the song of freedom fills the air
Say a prayer for the boys over there."
I'm Sorry I Made You Cry,['Connie Francis'],"I'm sorry dear, so sorry dear
I'm sorry I made you cry
Won't you forget, won't you forgive
Don't let us say goodbye
One little word, one little smile
One little kiss won't you try
It breaks my heart to hear you sigh
I'm sorry I made you cry

One little word, one little smile
One little kiss won't you try
It breaks my heart to hear you sigh
I'm sorry I made you cry"
Smiles,"[""Joseph C. Smith's Orchestra""]","Dearie, now I know just what makes me love you so
Just what holds me and enfolds me in its golden glow
Dearie, now I see ?????? smiles so bright and free
For life's sadness turns to gladness when you smile on me

There are smiles that make us happy
There are smiles that make us blue
There are smiles that steal away the teardrops
As the sunbeams steal away the dew

There are smiles that have a tender meaning
That the eyes of love alone may see
And the smiles that fill my life with sunshine
Are the smiles that you give to me

Dearie, when you smile, ev'rything in life's worthwhile
Love grows fonder as we wander down each magic mile
Dearie, melodies seem to float upon the breeze
Doves are cooing while they're wooing in the leafy trees

(Instrumental Break)

There are smiles that have a tender meaning
That the eyes of love alone may see
And the smiles that fill my life with sunshine
Are the smiles that you give to me
You give to me"
The Battle Hymn Of The Republic,"[""United States Army Field Band and Soldiers' Chorus""]","Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on, His truth is marching
Glory, glory, Hallelujah! Glory, glory, Hallelujah!
Glory, glory, Hallelujah! His truth is marching on
I have seen Him in the watch fires of a hundred circling camps
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps
His day is marching on
Hallelujah, Hallelujah!
In the beauty of the lilies, Christ was born across the sea
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me
As He died to make men holy, let us live to make men free
While God is marching on
Glory, glory, Hallelujah! Glory, glory, Hallelujah!
Glory, glory, Hallelujah! His truth is marching on!
His truth is marching on! And on and on and on and on and on"

After You've Gone,"['Bing Crosby', 'Turner Layton', 'Henry Creamer']","After you've gone and left me crying

You'll feel blue; you're gonna be sad
You've missed the dearest pal that (slickest partner) you ever had

There'll come a time, don't you forget it
(Yeah) there'll come a time when you're gonna regret it
Some day when you get lonely
Your heart will break like mine (and) you'll want me only

After you've gone (split) after you've gone away (flown the coop)

After we paid our dues together
You should have stayed through all that nasty weather
Someday while you're feeling badly
You'll need the only one that loves you so madly

But I'll be gone; yes, I'll be gone to stay
Yeah, after I've gone after I've gone away"
Somewhere In France Is the Lily (Recorded 1918),['Charles Hart'],"One day as morning shed its glow
Across the eastern sky,
A boy and girl in accents low,
In a garden said ""Goodbye!""
She said, ""Remember as you stray,
When each must do his share,
The flowers blooming here today
Are emblems over there!""
 
Chorus:
Somewhere in France is the Lily,
Close by the English Rose;
A Thistle so keen, and a Shamrock green,
And each loyal flow'r that grows.
Somewhere in France is a sweetheart,
Facing the battle's chance,
For the flow'r of our youth fights for freedom and truth
Somewhere in France.
Each morning in that garden fair,
Where sweetest perfumes dwell,
The lassie whispers low a pray'r
For the flowr's she loves so well.
And over there as night draws near,
Amid the shot and flame,
Unto the flag he holds so dear,
A soldier breathes her name."
Oui Oui Marie (Recorded 1918),['Arthur Fields'],"Poor Johnny's heart went pitty pat, Somewhere in sunny
France He met a girl by chance with ze naughty naughty

To dance and play, Tho' he learned no French when he left
The trench, He knew well enough to say:
Wee Wee Marie, will you do zis for me Wee Wee Marie,
Then I'll do zat for you, I love your eyes they make me feel
So spoony, You'll drive me loony, you're teasing me, Why
Can't we parleyvous like other sweethearts do, I want a
Kiss or two from Ma Cherie, Wee Wee Marie, if you'll
Do zis for me Then I'll do zat for you,
Wee Wee Marie.They walked along the boule boulevard, He whispered
""You for me, Some day in gay Paree I will make you
Marry me"", Just then a bunch of bully bully boys,
Threw kisses on the sly, Marie got wise when they rolled
Their eyes, They sang as they passed her by."

Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?
I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage
And each must play a part.
Fate had me playing in love you as my sweet heart.
Act one was when we met, I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two, you seemed to change and you acted strange
And why I'll never know.
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you.
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than go on living without you.
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then make them bring the curtain down.
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?"

"If He Can Fight Like He Can Love, Good Night Germany",['Most Happy Fellows'],"VERSE 1
Little Mary’s beau, said “I’ve got to go,
I must fight for Uncle Sam”
Standing in the crowd
Mary called aloud “Fare thee well my lovin’ man”
All the girls said “Ain’t he nice and tall,”
Mary answered “yes, and that’s not all.”

CHORUS 1
“If he can fight like he can love,
Oh, what a soldier boy he’ll be!
If he’s just half as good in a trench
As he was in the park on a bench.
Then ev’ry Hun, had better run
And find a great big linden tree,
I know he’ll be a Hero ”over there”
‘Cause he’s a bear in any Morris chair
And if he fights like he can love
Why, then it’s good night Germany!”
“If he can y!”

VERSE 2
Ev’ry single day, all the papers say,
Mary’s beau is oh, so brave
With his little gun, chasing ev’ry Hun
He has taught them to behave\
Little Mary proudly shakes her head,
And says “Do you remember when I said?”

CHORUS 2
“If he can fight like he can love,
Oh, what a soldier boy he’ll be!
If he’s just half as good in a trench
As he was in the park on a bench.
Then ev’ry Hun, had better run
And find a great big linden tree,
I never saw him in a real good scrap
But you’re goner when you’re in his lap
And if he fights like he can love
Why, then it’s good night Germany!”
“If he can y!”"
Love's Garden of Roses (Recorded 1918),['John McCormack'],"(Chorus) The sun and the rain fell from up above 
And landed on the earth below
In my garden of love

A forget-me-not to remind me to remember not to forget
A pine tree for the way I pined over you
And an ash for the day I ashed you to be true

(Chorus) And the sun.

Now there’s a palm tree that we planted when we had our first date
A turnip for the way you always used to turnip late
Your mother and your cousin, Chris, they often used to come
So, in their honour, I have raised a nice chris-an’-the-mum

(Chorus) And the sun.

Now there’s a beetroot for the day you said that you’d beetroot to me
A sweet pea for the sweet way you always smiled at me
But you had friends who needed you 
There was Ferdy, there was Liza
So, just for them, I put down a load of ferdy-liza

(Chorus) And the sun.

But Gus the gardener’s left now and you went with him, too
The fungus there reminds me of the fun Gus is having with you
Now the rockery’s a mockery, with weeds it’s overgrown
The fuchsia’s gone, I couldn’t face the fuchsia all alone

And my tears fell like raindrops from the sky above
And poisoned all the flowers in my garden of love"
They Were All Out of Step But Jim,['Chiefs of Staff'],"[Verse 1]
Jimmy's mother went to see her son
Marching along on parade
In his uniform and with his gun
What a lovely picture he made
She came home that evening
Filled up with delight
And to all the neighbors
She would yell with all her might

[Chorus]
""Did you see my little Jimmy marching
With the soldiers up the avenue?
There was Jimmy just as stiff as starch
Just like his father on the seventeenth o' March
Did you notice all the lovely ladies
Casting their eyes at him?
Away he went
To live in a tent
Over in France with his regiment
Were you there, and tell me, did you notice?
They were all out of step but Jim""

[Verse 2]
That night little Jimmy's father stood
Buying the drinks for the crowd
You could tell that he was feeling good
He was talking terribly loud
Twenty times he treated
My, but he was dry
When his glass was empty
He would treat again and cry

[Chorus]
""Did you see me little Jimmy marching
With the soldiers up the avenue?
There was Jimmy just as stiff as starch
Like his father on the seventeenth o' March
Did you notice all the lovely ladies
A-casting their eyes at him?
Sure it made me glad
To gaze at the lad
And Lord help the Kaiser if he's like his dad
Were you there, oh you were, well did you notice?
They were all out of step but Jim"""
The Daughter Of Rosie O'Grady,['Ian Whitcomb'],"Just down around the corner
of the street where I reside,
There lives the cutest little girl
that I have ever spied;
Her name is Rose O'Grady and,
I don't mind telling you,
That she's the sweetest little Rose
the garden ever grew.

Sweet Rosie O'Grady,
My dear little Rose,
She's my steady lady,
Most ev'ryone knows.
And, when we are married,
How happy we'll be;
I love sweet Rosie O'Grady,
And Rosie O'Grady loves me.

I never shall forget the day
she promised to be mine,
As we sat telling love tales
in the golden summer time.
'Twas on her finger that I placed
a small engagement ring,
While in the trees, the little birds
this song they seemed to sing!

Sweet Rosie O'Grady,
My dear little Rose,
She's my steady lady,
Most ev'ryone knows.
And, when we are married,
How happy we'll be;
I love sweet Rosie O'Grady,
And Rosie O'Grady loves me."
My Buddy,['Henry Burr'],"Nights are long since you went away,
I think about you all through the day,
My buddy, my buddy, no buddy quite so true.
Miss your voice, the touch of your hand,
Just long to know that you understand,
My buddy, my buddy, your buddy misses you
Miss your voice, the touch of your hand,
Just long to know that you understand,
My buddy, my buddy, your buddy misses you"
Hindustan,"[""Joseph C. Smith's Orchestra""]","Camel trappings jingle, harp strings tingle
With a sweet voice mingle, underneath the stars
Singing, memories are bringing
Temple bells are ringing, calling me afar


Hindustan, my Hindustan, where we stopped to rest our tired caravan
Hindustan, my Hindustan, where the painted peacock proudly spreads his fan
Hindustan, my Hindustan, where the purple sunbird flashed across the sand
Hindustan, my Hindustan, where I met her and the world began


Shades of night are falling, nightingales are calling
Every heart enthralling, underneath the stars
Sighing, like the night wind dying
Soft my heart is crying for my love afar


Hindustan, my Hindustan, where we stopped to rest our tired caravan
Hindustan, my Hindustan, where the painted peacock proudly spreads his fan
Hindustan, my Hindustan, where the purple sunbird flashed across the sand
Hindustan, my Hindustan, where I met her and the world began"
God Be With Our Boys To-Night,"['Jon English, Rob Carriker, Marlborough Singers & Marlborough Chamber Players']","Brave eyes that looked so tenderly,
Where are you now today?
Sad was our heart at break of dawn,
After you went away.
Loud sang the lark o’er fields of gold,
High in the heavens above;
Winter alone within our hearts,
Calling for you we love.

Chorus:
O waiting heart, I dare not tell
How dark and long the lane!
Only I pray that God will bring
Our dear ones back again
Safe to a home of peace and light
Across the furthest sea;
May God be with our boys tonight,
Wherever they may be.

Brave ones who answered your country’s call,
How could we let you go
Out of the sunshine of our souls,
Save that we love you so?
There is a place within our hearts
No one on earth may fill;
Someday at last you’ll come back to us,
Watching and longing still!"
Everybody's Crazy 'Bout The Doggone Blues,['Mark Murphy'],"Lyrics:

1. Blues ain’t nothin’ but the
Easy goin’ heart disease
Brother stop your moanin’
Blues can’t make you warmer
If you’re bound to freeze
Sister stop your groanin’
Why don’t you rise and shine
Take dem blues right off your mind
‘Cause the blues ain’t nothin’
But the easy goin’ heart disease
That’s all! Lawd!

Chorus:
Everybody’s crazy ’bout the doggone blues
But I’m happy, (whew) yes happy, (whew)
Everybody’s crazy, but if I must choose
No doggone blues for mine
I gets aplenty to eat, I never worry
Shoes on my feet, don’t have to hurry
I’m not afraid, my rent is paid
And I can sleep at ninety-four in the shade
Everybody’s singing lotta bad old news
But I’m happy, (whew) yes happy, (whew)
Life’s too doggone short to weep and whine
Dem home sickness blues, Lawd! take ’em away
Every body’s crazy ’bout the doggone blues
But I’m happy all of the time, (whew)

2. You all know how Mister Jonah
Got into that whale
Fell into the ocean
There’s one man that should have
Sung the blues but failed
Never had the notion
Old Jonah knew dem whales
‘Stead of blues he ragged the scales
Then the whale got gay and let
Old Jonah slip right out of jail
No lie! Lawd!"
Where the Morning Glories Grow,['Dear Nora'],"I remember, I remember
The place where I was born
Where the morning glories twine
Around the door at early morn

I've forgotten, I've forgotten
How long I've been away
But I'd like to wander back again
Down the lane to yesterday

I want to wake up in the morning
Where the morning glories grow
Where the sun comes peeping in
Where I'm sleeping and the songbirds say, ""Hello""

I long to wander in the wild wood
Where the rippling waters flow
And go drifting back to childhood
Where the morning glories grow

I remember, I remember
The schoolhouse on the hill
And I wonder if the tiny folks
Are climbing up there still

I can picture, I can picture
The dear old swimming pool
And the happy days that I spent there
When I should have been in school

I want to wake up in the morning
Where the morning glories grow
Where the sun comes peeping in
Where I'm sleeping and the songbirds say, ""Hello""

I long to wander in the wild wood
Where the rippling waters flow
And go drifting back to childhood
Where the morning glories grow"

Roses Of Picardy,['Alfie Boe'],"She is watching by the poplars
Colinette with the sea-blue eyes
She is watching and longing, and waiting
Where the long white roadway lies
And a song stirs in the silence
As the wind in the boughs above
She listens and starts and trembles
'Tis the first little song of love

Roses are shining in Picardy
In the hush of the silver dew
Roses are flowering in Picardy
But there's never a rose like you!
And the roses will die with the summertime
And our roads may be far apart
But there's one rose that dies not in Picardy
'Tis the rose that I keep in my heart

And the years fly on forever
Till the shadows veil their skies
But he loves to hold her little hands
And look into her sea-blue eyes
And she sees the road by the poplars
Where they met in the bygone years
For the first little song of the roses
Is the last little song she hears:

Roses are shining in Picardy
In the hush of the silver dew
Roses are flowering in Picardy
But there's never a rose like you!
And the roses will die with the summertime
And our roads may be far apart
But there's one rose that dies not in Picardy
'Tis the rose that I keep in my heart"
K-K-K-Katy,['Billy Murray'],"Jimmy was a soldier brave and bold
Katy was a maid with hair of gold
Like an act of fate, Kate was standing at the gate
Watching all the boys file on parade
Kate smiled with a twinkle in her eye
Jim said ""M-m-meet you by-and-by!""
That same night at eight
Jim was at the garden gate
Stuttering this song to K-K-K-Kate

K-K-K-Katy, beautiful Katy
You're the only g-g-g-girl that I adore
When the m-m-m-moon shines
Over the cow shed
I'll be waiting at the k-k-k-kitchen door

""No one could be just as cute and sweet!""

When the wedding ring he bought
Now he's off to France the foe to meet
Jimmy thought he'd like to take a chance
See if he could make the Kaiser dance
Stepping to a tune
All about the silv'ry moon
This is what they hear in far off France

Just a Girl That Men Forget (Victor 19131) [Recorded 1923],['Henry Burr'],"1. Dear little girl, they call you a Vamp
A flapper with up-to-date ways
You may shine brightly but just like a lamp
You’ll burn out one of these days
Then your old fashioned sister will com into view
With a huband and kiddies, but what abou you?

Chorus:
You’re the kind of a girl that men forget
Just a toy to enjoy for a while
For when men settle down
They get an old fashioned girl
With an old fashioned smile
And you’ll soon realize you’re not so wise
When the years bring you tears of regret
When they play “Here comes the bride”
You’ll stand outside
Just a girl that men forget

2. Wall flower girl, now dry all those tears
For you won’t be left all alone
Some day you’ll find yourself upon a throne
Queen of a sweet little home
And you gay little flapper, you’ll live and you’ll learn
When you’ve gone down the pathway that has no return"
When I Leave the World Behind (Recorded 1915),['Henry Burr'],"I know a millionaire
Who's burdened down with care
A load Is on his mind
He's thinking of the day
When he must pass away
And leave his world behind
I haven't any gold
To leave when I grow old
Somehow its passed by
I'm very poor but still
I leave a precious will
When i must say goodbye
I leave the sunshine to the flowers
I leave the spring time to the trees
And to the old folk I leave a memory
Of a baby upon their knees
I leave the nighttime to the dreamers
I leave the songbird to the blind
I leave the moon above to those in love
when I leave the world behind, when I leave the world behind
I leave the sunshine to the flowers
I leave the springtime to the trees
And to the old folk I leave a memory
Of a baby upon their knees
I leave the nighttime to the dreamers
I leave the songbird to the blind
I leave the moon above to those in love
When I leave the world behind
When I leave the world behind"
There's a Little Blue Star in the Window (WW1 Song) [Victor 18524] [Recorded 1918],['Henry Burr'],"There’s a Little Blue Star in the Window and it Means all the World to Me [Verse] There’s a little blue star in the window, And it means all the world to me
There’s a lad who is true To the Red, White and Blue, And he’s serving his Flag o’er the sea. But it does not reflect golden sunshine, Never gleams in the dead of night
In the brightness of day, As the night wears away, It shines with its own holy light. [Refrain] There are stars in the high heavens shining With a promise of hope in their light. There are stars in the field of Old Glory, The emblem of honor and right. But no star ever shone with more brightness, I know, Than the one for my boy o’er the sea
There’s a little blue star in the window, And it means all the world to me. [Verse] When the sun sinks to rest in the evening And the stars in the dark’ning sky Shine with soft, tender light, Till the heavens are bright, Then a glorious sight greets the eye. But the brightest of stars in the heavens Does not shine with the brilliancy As the little one there In the window--my pray'r For my laddie over the sea. [Refrain]"
Indianola,['Charlie Robison'],"My little brother was just ten years old
When we hit bad weather and hid in the hole
We could see Texas was only a mile
And oh, little brother, I remember your smile
At Indianola

My dad built a sawmill of cypreses and stone
It was here on Madena that we made our home
The year 1850 and I sent for my girl
Oh Frauline, come meet me in this brand new world
At Indianola

The war they call civil had barely begun
Me and my cousins decided we'd run
Up through Louisianan to meet up with Grant
But one hundred damn rebels shot us there in the sand
At Indianola

They said up in New York, the stock market fell
And the life they was livin' was shot all to hell
But we ain't seen nothin' no different than dust
Sept the wheels on the wagon all covered with rust
At Indianola

And that scrape with old Hitler was over and done
And I wondered if I could kill kin with my gun
But we sat there in Paris in a little caf√©
And as they toasted Truman, I drifted away
To Indianola

But it's fifty years later and nobody cares
About some old city that ain't even there
Well, my sons moved to Houston
And they work in the Gulf
With seven days on and seven days off

Well I work for the doctor that bought our old ranch
From first quality federal the foreclosures branch
And he calls me hillbilly and he laughs at my hair
But the cancer will get him if anything's fair

And I'll take his ashes and throw from my boat
As they crossed that ocean I'm going to float
To find me another Indianola
Indianola
Indianola"
When Alexander Takes His Ragtime Band to France,['Marion Harris'],"[Verse 1]
What’s that tune I hear? A ringing in my ear
Come on along, come on along, It’s a wonderful idea
It’s Alexander’s band, from down in Dixieland
He’s going “over there” to do his share

[Chorus]
When Alexander takes his ragtime band to France
He’ll capture ev’ry Hun, and take them one by one
Those ragtime tunes will put the Germans in a trance
They’ll throw their guns away, hip hip hooray!
And start right in to dance
They’ll get so excited they’ll come over the top
Two step back to Berlin with a skip and a hop
Old Hindenburg will know he has no chance
When Alexander takes his ragtime band to France

[Verse 2]
There’s no time to lose, they’ll put on dancing shoes
They’ll glide away, and slide away
When they hear those weary blues
The goose step’s on the wane, the two step’s in again
Like they advanced at first, they’ve just reversed

[Chorus]
When Alexander takes his ragtime band to France
He’ll capture ev’ry Hun, and take them one by one
Those ragtime tunes will put the Germans in a trance
They’ll throw their guns away, hip hip hooray!
And start right in to dance
They’ll get so excited they’ll come over the top
Two step back to Berlin with a skip and a hop
Old Hindenburg will know he has no chance
When Alexander takes his ragtime band to France"
Let the Rest of the World Go By,"['Elizabeth Spencer', 'Charles Hart']","With someone like you, a pal good and true

We'll build a sweet little nest somewhere in the west

My Baby Boy,['theAngelcy'],"My baby boy is in the army of disbelief.
My baby boy is in the army of midsummer grief.
Tossing and turning in his bed,
Guessing his own end,
Tossing and turning in his bed,
My baby boy's already dead.
We are a natural disaster,
Shake, mama, shake your head.
We are a natural disaster,
Lost all hope to ever understand
The powers in command here.
Pray for my baby boy.
No bombs to drop and kill them all,
No money paid to charge our souls,
No mind control, no wall,
Just summer, winter, spring and fall.
We are a natural disaster,
Shake, mama, shake your head.
We are a natural disaster,
Lost all hope to ever understand
The powers in command here.
Pray for my baby boy."
Liberty Bell,['The Peerless Quartet'],"No brainwaves or activity
While the craft is in the air
It's getting dark, it's getting light
We are sitting in a chair
We have fastened every belt
We cannot float out of our seats
It's so enormously frightening
When our tail reaches superheat
Another timezone
A change of season
It is turning dark again
We're getting ready for yet
Another orbit around our planet
It is time for the galactic cruise
To come to an end
One last view on the world
And the time we have spend
We are sitting in a chair
Sitting in a chair
Sitting in a chair"
"There's a Long, Long Trail",['Sons of the Pioneers'],"Nights are growing lonely,
Days are very long;
I'm a-growing weary
Only list'ning for your song.
Old remembrances are thronging
Thro' my memory,
Thronging till it seems
The world is full of dreams,
Just to call you back to me.

There's a long, long trail a-winding
Into the land of my dreams,
Where nightingales are singing
And a white moon beams:
There's a long, long night of waiting
Until my dreams all come true;
Till the day when I'll be going down
That long, long trail with you.

All night long I hear you calling,
Calling sweet and low;
Seem to hear your footsteps falling
Ev'ry where I go.
Tho' the road between us stretches
Many a weary mile,
Somehow I forget
That you're not with me yet
When I think I see you smile.

There's a long, long trail a-winding
Into the land of my dreams,
Where nightingales are singing
And a white moon beams:
There's a long, long night of waiting
Until my dreams all come true;
Till the day when I'll be going down
That long, long trail with you."

Watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams
Ending in the sky

I always look and find the rain
Some fellows make a winning sometime
I never even make a gain, believe me

Waiting to find a little bluebird in vain"
Danny Boy,['The Irish Tenors'],"O Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountainside
The summer's gone and all the roses dying
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
O Danny boy, O Danny boy, I love you so

And when you come and all the flowers are dying
If I am dead, as dead I well may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an Ave there for me

And I shall hear, though soft your tread above me
And all my grave shall warmer, sweeter be
For you will bend and tell me that you love me
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me"
Love's Old Sweet Song,['John McCormack'],"Once in the dear dead days beyond recall.
When on the world the mists began to fall,
Out of the dreams that rose in happy throng
Low to our hearts love sang an old sweet song
And in the dusk where fell the firelight gleam
Softly it wove itself into our dream
Just a song at twilight
When the lights are low,
And the flickering shadows
Softly come and go
Though the heart be weary,
Sad the day and long,
Still to us at twilight comes love's old song
Comes love's old sweet song.
Even today we hear love's song of yore
Deep in our hearts it dwells forever more
Footsteps may falter, weary grows our way
Still we can hear it at the close of day
So till the end when life's dim shadows fall
Love will be found the sweetest song of all.
Just a song at twilight
When the lights are low,
And the flickering shadows
Softly come and go
Though the heart be weary,
Sad the day and long,
Still to us at twilight comes love's old song
Comes love's old sweet song."
Lucky Lindy,['Irving Kaufman'],"From coast to coast, we all can boast and sing a toast to one
Who's made a name
By being game.
He was born with wings as great as any bird that flies
A lucky star
Led him afar!

cho: Lucky Lindy! Up in the sky
Fair or windy, he's flying high.
Peerless, fearless --- knows every cloud
The kind of a son makes a mother feel proud!
Lucky Lindy! Flies all alone
In a little plane all his own,
Lucky Lindy shows them the way
And he's the hero of the day.

Just like a child, he simply smiled while we went wild with fear
That Yankee lad!
The world went mad!
Everywhere we prayed for him to safely cross the sea
And he arrived
In gay Par-ee!"
A Precious Little Thing Called Love,['Irving Kaufman'],"Why does my heart miss a beat
At some footsteps on the street
It's a precious little thing called love

Why am I content alone
When I know someone will phone
It's a precious little thing called love

I see a day in June, a wedding tune
A honeymoon cruise
Friends I know who will throw
Some rice and old shoes

What's the one thing makes me say
Heaven's just across the way
It's a precious little thing called love

(Instrumental Break)

I was on my way to Dr. Cupid
I was all upset, I was in doubt
Suddenly I laughed with glee
There was nothing wrong with me
For I guessed what it was all about

Oh, nunna-nunna, oh, nunna-nunna-nunna
I do, I do, I do-do-do
That precious thing called love

It's so hard to concentrate
I don't even know the date
It's a precious little thing that they call love

I see a day in June, a wedding tune
A honeymoon cruise
Friends that I know who will then throw
Rice and old shoes

What's the one thing makes me say
Heaven's just across the way
It's that precious little thing called love

That's all!"

And here's the reason why
Every time we cuddle
It works just like a lullaby!
I hear the parson in the hall
For we'd be there if I should fall!
Tonight's my night with baby
Feels just like I'm walkin' on wheels
I feel that I could fly!
Look in my eye
And you'll see why!
Just had rubber
Put on my heels
I've no time to lose!
Do your duty, shoes!
I'm run 'way from the blues!
If she says ""yes""
Then I'll say ""yes""
If she says ""no""
I'll still say ""yes""!
Tonight's my night with baby
And If she says ""do""
I'll say ""do""
If she says ""don't""
I'll do say ""do"", ha!
Tonight's my night with baby
We'll move to the north pole
I know that we're not wrong
You know, at the north pole
The nights up there are six months long!
I guess she's nice, I hope I'm right
But if I'm wrong I'll know tonight!
Tonight's my night with baby
I got my ma
Got my pa
I put 'em on my motor car!
Tonight's my night with baby
And I said to my driver, ""Jack
Just drive and drive and don't come back!""
'Cause tonight's my night with baby
Say, we've seen every movie
We've seen every play
We gotta have amusement
But we want it in a different way!
I fixed the lights at half past ten
They'll all blow out, oh boy, and then
Tonight's my night with baby!"
No Place Like Home (Columbia 2438) [Recorded 1917],['Bert Williams'],"Pay no attention
to the man behind the curtain
He's a brainless, heartless, coward
with no power
That's just another trick of his
He ain't no wiz
don't fear his fire
Jump in my balloon,
I'll take you higher
Take you somewhere over the rainbow
Get your ticket to the show
Heels click, and here we go
Cuz you already know
There's no place like (home)
Uh
There's no place like (home)
There's no place like (home)
There's no place like
(We're straight outta Oz)
There's no place like home
It's where the heart is
Some brainiacs will tell you
home is where your house and car is
But if you're brave enough
to love the ones you hate the hardest
You might find (home)
You might find (home)
Cause sometimes
home is where your deepest scar is
Society will try to cast you
where they think your part is
Give awards and accolades
to what they think a star is
But go find your (home)
Go find your (home)
Pay no attention
to the lies they try to feed you
It's a wicked, twisted fable
He's not stable
It's just another box of tricks
a crock of shit and good dreams
go wasted
Hoping for the fame
don't let him taste it
He's been stealing dreams
nine to five, Monday to Friday
I'mma tell the story my way
cause the only way home
Ain't on this yellow brick highway
There's no place like (home)
There's no place like (home)
There's no place like (home)
There's no place like
(We're straight outta Oz)
There's not place like
If you're lost out there
in the night
Wishing on stars
wonder who you are
Just know that
you're never alone
And there's no
place like home
And we gon' fight
and we gon' cry
And I'm gon' fight
for you until I die
Right there is like
where you belong
And there's no place
like home
Pay no attention
to the man who tried to change you
He's a dark familiar stranger
But that's the danger
The storm is strong
But it won't be long
And no matter where you roam
There's no place like (home)"
Everything Is Peaches Down in Georgia,['Bob Schulz'],"Everything is peaches down in Georgia
Lyrictext	
Down in Georgia there are peaches
Waiting for you yes and each is
Sweet as any peach that you could reach for a tree
Southern beauties they are famous
Georgia's where they grow
My folks write me, they invite me
Don't you want to go?

Everything is peaches down in Georgia
What a peach of a clime
For a peach of a time
Believe me, paradise is waiting down there for you
I've got a peach of a pa, peach of a ma
Oh, what a peach of a couple they are
There's a preacher preaches down in Georgia
Always ready to say
Will you love and obey
I bet you'll pich yourself a peach of a wife
Settle down to a peach of a life
Everything is peaches down in Georgia

All of Giorgia's full of peaches
They're all georgeous, each one reaches
Right into your heart and makes you part of Georgia too
Clingstone peaches cling right to you

Peaches haunt your dream
Think of getting always getting
Peaches in your cream

Everything is peaches down in Georgia
What a peach of a clime
For a peach of a time
Believe me, paradise is waiting down there for you
I've got a peach of a pa, peach of a ma
Oh, what a peach of a couple they are
There's a preacher preaches down in Georgia
Always ready to say
Will you love and obey
I bet you'll pich yourself a peach of a wife
Settle down to a peach of a life
Everything is peaches down in Georgia"
I'd Like to Be a Monkey in the Zoo (Victor 45149) [Recorded 1917],['Francis White'],"i'm chained to the wall
i'm nothing at all
and my eyes look into the sunset thinking of better things to do
like a monkey in a zoo
the days go so slow
i don't have no friends
except all these people who want me to do tricks for them
like a monkey in a zoo
and it could happen to you
you could be in my place
no it wasn't always like this
oh but i never saw it coming
i'm so alone
but this is my home
and the bars that surround me keep me from knowing any better
like a monkey in a zoo
throw me a peanut
laugh and make jokes
but i've had enough peanuts and i'm ready to croak
like a monkey in a zoo
you come to look at me
you seem so amused
but things would look different
if you were in my shoes
i know it's my fault
but i want out
and when i cry out nobody seems to understand
like a monkey in a zoo
you say i'm cute
you don't know how much that hurts
you don't know how it feels to live in your own dirt
like a monkey in a zoo
and it could happen to you
you could be in my place
don't let yourself slip
don't keep egg on your face
i used to be happy
i can't remember those days
but i sold my freedom for free room and board
like a monkey in a zoo"
"We Don't Want the Bacon, All We Want Is a Piece of the Rhine (Recorded 1918)",['The Peerless Quartet'],"If you've read your history then
You're bound to know;
That we have always held our own
With any foe;
We've always brought the bacon home
No matter what they've done,
But we don't want the bacon now;
We're out to get the hun!
We don't want the bacon,
We don't want the bacon,
What we want is a piece of the Rhine.
We'll hit Bill Kaiser on the head
And make him wiser,
We'll have a wonderful time!
Old Wilhelm Der Gross,
Will shout ""Vas is los?""
When we hit that hindenburg line,
We don't want the bacon,
We don't want the bacon,
What we want is a piece of the Rhine!
When first this war began,
They said we'd had no chance;
They couldn't figure how
We'd get out into France,
But they will soon discover
Uncle Sam is out to win;
We've got the Fritzies on the run,
We're headed for Berlin!
We don't want the bacon,
We don't want the bacon,
What we want is a piece of the Rhine!
We'll hit Bill Kaiser on the head
And make him wiser,
We'll have a wonderful time!
Old Wihelm Der Grosse,
Will shout ""Vas is Los?""
When we hit that Hindenburg line,
We don't want the bacon,
We don't want the bacon,
What we want is a piece of the Rhine!
Old Wilhelm Der Grosse,
Will shout ""Vas is los?""
When we hit that Hindenburg line,
We don't want the bacon,
We don't want the bacon,
What we want is a piece of the Rhine!"
A Little Bit of Sunshine,['Lone Man Extraordinary'],"Washed streets feel the sun beat down upon you
I can see as the wind catch your hair your face smiles
And I know deep inside that you're wondering why you're hurting
Try not to hide cause I know we'll make it through Cause what we have is gonna last
A little bit of sunshine, a little bit of rain
We're gonna make it through this
Yeah we can start again
It's a little bit of sunshine, a little bit of rain
We're gonna make it through this
Yeah we can start again
And I know it's hard for you now
Yeah I feel the same but I'm holding on some how
Stand by me and I will stand by you
And the love that we have will help me make it through
C'est la vie mon ami
It's a little bit of sunshine, A little bit of rain
We're gonna make it through this
Yeah we can start again
It's little bit of sunshine,
A little bit of rain
We're gonna make it through this
Yeah we can start again
But it's true gotta want it gotta need it so bad
Can't let it slip out of our hands
Gotta hold on tight make it right
Gotta carry on stayin' strong
In my heart I can't believe
That you or I would leave
Yeah I'm holding tight, holding tight
Holding on to you,
My little bit of sunshine
My little bit rain coming
We're gonna make it through this
Yeah we can start again
It's a little bit of sunshine, A little bit of rain
We're gonna make it through this
Yeah we can start again
my little bit of sunshine
My little bit rain coming
We're gonna make it through this
Yeah we can start again"
Melody Lane,['Uncle Acid & The Deadbeats'],"I'll take a walk behind Melody Lane
I'll follow her as she turns through the rain
They say she's good but I can't feel the same
I want her
I saw her dance when she first hit the scene
Creep joint romancing with amphetamines
But tramps like me stay in shadows unseen
I went her
I'm not her kind of lover
My mind will not recover
I just want my time with her
MELODY LANE
I'm not the kind to kill her
I just want drugs to thrill her
We'll spend the night together
MELODY LANE
Her face lit up under yellow street light
With eyes of fear as she caught me in sight
I won't hurt her, but she knows that I might
I WANT HER
She pulled a knife as she lunged in the dark
Cut up my arm like a bloody remark
The curtains twitched and the hound dogs did bark
She left me for dead
I'm not her kind of lover
My mind will not recover
I just want my time with her
MELODY LANE
I'm not the kind to kill her
I just want drugs to thrill her
We'll spend the night together
MELODY LANE
I staggered on my way home
Past leering eyes and taunting voices
As blood dripped from my flesh wound
I knew my thoughts would scream in terror
Forever and ever ...
Too bad she's gone, Melody Lane"
Keep the Home Fires Burning,['John McCormack'],"They were summoned from the hillside
They were called in from the glen,
And the country found them ready
At the stirring call for men.
Let no tears add to their hardships
As the soldiers pass along,
And although your heart is breaking
Make it sing this cheery song
Keep the Home Fires Burning,
While your hearts are yearning,
Though your lads are far away
They dream of home.
There's a silver lining
Through the dark clouds shining,
Turn the dark cloud inside out
'Til the boys come home.
Overseas there came a pleading,
""Help a nation in distress.""
And we gave our glorious laddies
Honour bade us do no less,
For no gallant son of freedom
To a tyrant's yoke should bend,
And a noble heart must answer
To the sacred call of ""Friend.""
Keep the Home Fires Burning,
While your hearts are yearning,
Though your lads are far away
They dream of home.
There's a silver lining
Through the dark clouds shining,
Turn the dark cloud inside out
'Til the boys come home."
Yes Sir! That's My Baby,['Irving Kaufman'],"Who's that coming down the street?
Who's that looking so petite?
Who's that coming down to meet me here?
Who's that you know who I mean,
Sweetest ""who"" you've ever seen,
I could tell him miles away from here.
Yes sir, that's my baby
No sir, I don't mean maybe
Yes sir, that's my baby now
Yes, ma'am, we've decided
No ma'am, we won't hide it
Yes, ma'am, you're invited now
Oh by the way, oh by the way
When we reach the preacher I'll say (with feeling!)
Yes sir, that's my baby
No sir, I don't mean maybe
Yes sir, that's my baby now!"
I'm Always Chasing Rainbows,['Charles Harrison'],"I'm always chasing rainbows
Watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams
Ending in the sky
Some fellows look and find the sunshine
I always look and find the rain
Some fellows make a winning sometime
I never even make a gain, believe me
I'm always chasing rainbows
Waiting to find a little bluebird in vain
Some fellows look and find the sunshine
But I always look and find the rain
Some fellows make a winning sometime
I never even make a gain, believe me
I'm always chasing rainbows
Waiting to find a little bluebird in vain"
Livery Stable Blues,['Original Dixieland Jazz Band'],"Listen to your heart,
Listen to the clock,
Listen to the train.
A heart's got rhythm,
A clock's got rhythm,
A train's got rhythm.
You gotta have rhythm
to clap your hands,
You gotta have rhythm
to tap your feet,
You gotta have rhythm
to understand
What makes jazz is a good downbeat!
Your heart starts pumpin',
Your feet start stompin',
The whole world's jumpin';
You feel like bustin' outta your skin,
It's jazz that's got you in a spin,
You feel you've got the world
in your hand --
Jazz can really make you understand.
A rollercoaster in the sky,
A red-hot trumpet's lullabye,
A lamppost on a rainy night,
A lonesome white electric light;
A brand-new pair of golden shoes,
A bullfrog singin' out the blues --
It's all connected with a beat
That goes right down from your heart to your feet.
Is your big heart thumpin'?
Yeah, man!
Are your two feet jumpin'?
Yeah, man!
Now ain't that somethin'?
Yeah, man!
That little bit of somethin' called Jazz"

I Hate to Lose You,['The Savoy Quartet'],"I hate to lose you,
I'm so used to you now,
Still I excuse you
For breaking your vow.

Just like the sunlight, I've found
I'm used to havin' you 'round.
You're all I've ever been thinkin' of,
Who am I gonna love,
Now that you've turned me down?

Just like the rose, dear,
That's used to the sun,
Its petals close, dear,
When Summer is done.

And I'm so used to your kisses, all the others seem strange,
Used to your lovin' and I don't wanna change.
I hate to lose you,
I'm so used to you now!

I hate to lose you,

Used to your lovin' and I don't want to change.

I'm so used to you now!"
